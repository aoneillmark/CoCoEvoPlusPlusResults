This is added to clarify that the CPT rule for Mike is tied to his visa status. The original premise for Mike only stated \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\", which is broad. However, given the context of F1/J1 visas, it's more precise to link it to visa. This premise assumes Mike is in the US and an international student, which is already established.\n\u2200x (IsMike(x) \u2227 WantsToWork(x) \u2227 \u00acHasF1Visa(x) \u2192 \u00acNeedsToApply(x, OPTApplication())) ::: Mike does not need to apply for OPT if he does not have an F1 visa.
