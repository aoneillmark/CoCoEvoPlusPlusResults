categories.\n# If they are meant to be general types, then OccurIn should be used with individual instances or with a predicate like IsA.\n# For simplicity and to match the likely intent of the original, we'll assume OccurIn applies to general categories.\n# If Animal(x) was meant for any animal, and Human(x) for any human, then OccurIn(mpv, Animal) and OccurIn(mpv, Human) would be more direct.\n# Let's refine to use predicates for individual entities and a relation for types.\n\n# Re-interpreting OccurIn for clarity on what 'humans' and 'animals' represent:\n# If 'humans' and

`OccurIn(mpv, x)` where `Animal(x)` or `Human(x)` holds for 'x'.\n# The original implies 'humans' and 'animals' are variables or constants.\n# Let's assume they are constants representing the general concepts.\n\n# Alternative interpretation and fix:\n# If 'humans' and 'animals' were intended as general types/classes,\n# and `OccurIn(x, y)` means \"x can occur in instances of y\",\n# then the premises should reflect that.\n# However, the current predicates suggest x and y are specific entities.\n\n# Let's stick to the original structure and assume 'humans' and 'animals' are specific constants\n# that `OccurIn` can take as arguments representing the groups.\n\n# Revised Premises based on likely intent of OccurIn:\n# `OccurIn(mpv, AnimalCategory)` and `OccurIn(mpv, HumanCategory)` where AnimalCategory and HumanCategory are constants.\n# For example, let AnimalCategory be 'all_animals' and HumanCategory be 'all_humans'.\n# If the original meant `OccurIn(mpv, x)` for any `x` such that `Animal(x)` or `Human(x)`, then it would be:\n# \u2200x (Animal(x) \u2192 OccurIn(mpv, x))\n# \u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 OccurIn(mpv, x))\n\n# Given the simplicity of the original, let's assume specific constants representing these groups:\n# Assume `humans` and `animals` are constants representing the set/category of humans and animals.\n# For this to work, we might need predicates like `IsCategory(x)` or redefine `OccurIn`.\n\n# Simplification and correction:\n# The original premises `OccurIn(mpv, humans)` and `OccurIn(mpv, animals)` are problematic if `humans` and `animals` are meant to be universally quantified variables.\n# If they are constants representing the general groups, then it's syntactically fine but semantically might need clarification.\n# A more robust way is

It states \"feeling tired\" is a symptom.\n\n# Let's consider simplifying the symptom representation. Instead of instances,\n# let's use predicates that describe the condition itself.\n# This is a minor change, the current approach is fine.\n\n# Edge case: What if the \"glu\" is not an illness but a generic term?\n# The wording \"when they get a glu\" suggests an event or condition.\n# The current `Glu(a_glu)` is one interpretation.\n\n# Let's focus on simplifying the overall logic or fixing implicit assumptions.\n# The current program is quite direct.\n# The first premise: \"Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans.\"\n# And the generalization: \u2200x (Animal(x) \u2192 OccurIn(mp_virus, x))\n# This means the virus occurs in *all* animals.\n# The \"including humans\" is then redundant if humans are animals.\n# It's good to keep both to reflect the original statement's emphasis, but also to be precise.\n# The current premises correctly capture this.\n\n# Simplification:\n# The relationship between FeelingTired(x) as a symptom and the FeelTiredWhen(x, y) predicate.\n# Currently, `FeelingTired(tiredness_symptom)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness_symptom, mp)`.\n# And `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, a_glu))`.\n# This means a human feels tired when they get a glu.\n# If a human has Monkeypox, and tiredness is a symptom, then that human experiences tiredness.\n# The connection is that this tiredness *might* be due to a 'glu'.\n# The original program does not explicitly link the symptom of tiredness to the 'glu' event.\n\n# Revised approach for simplifying/clarifying the tiredness:\n# If a human has monkeypox, they *might* experience the symptom of tiredness.\n# And if a human gets a glu, they *will* feel tired.\n# We can add a premise that if tiredness is a symptom of Monkeypox in a human,\n# that human experiences tiredness.\n# And that this tiredness can be understood as a state that can be caused by a 'glu'.\n\n# Let's refine the symptom statement to be more direct:\n# FeelingTired(x) can be a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# This is already captured by `SymptomOf(tiredness_condition, mp)`.\n\n# The problem might be in the interpretation of `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)`.\n# Does it mean `y` is the *sole* cause, or *a* cause?\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" implies that getting a glu is a sufficient condition for feeling tired.\n\n# A possible simplification or clarification:\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" can be rephrased as:\n# For any person x, if x experiences a glu (event/condition), then x feels tired.\n# Let's rename `a_glu` to `glu_event` for clarity.\nGlu(glu_event)\n# For any person x, if x experiences `glu_event`, then x feels tired.\n# The predicate `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` captures this.\n# If we interpret `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` as \"x feels tired *because of* y\", then\n# `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, glu_event))` is good.\n\n# How to link the symptom of tiredness to this:\n# If a human x has Monkeypox (OccurIn(mp, x)), and tiredness is a symptom of Monkeypox (SymptomOf(tiredness_condition, mp)),\n# then x experiences the condition of tiredness.\n# Let's denote that a person `x` experiences a condition `c` as `Experiences(x, c)`.\n# We can add: `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Experiences(x, tiredness_condition))` (This is too strong - it's a *possible* symptom).\n# A better way: If `tiredness_condition` is a symptom of `mp`, and `mp` is in `x`, then `x` experiences `tiredness_condition`.\n# This is a common inference pattern:\n# `\u2200x, d (InfectiousDisease(d) \u2227 SymptomOf(c, d) \u2227 OccurIn(d, x) \u2192 Experiences(x, c))`\n# We can add this general rule and use it.\n# However, the original program doesn't have `Experiences` predicate.\n\n# Let's stick to the provided predicates.\n# The current structure seems to imply:\n# 1. MP causes tiredness (as a symptom).\n# 2. Glu causes tiredness (in humans).\n\n# The ambiguity is whether the tiredness symptom of MP *is* a \"glu\".\n# If we assume `FeelingTired(x)` means `x` is in a state of being tired, and\n# `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` means `y` is a cause for `x` to be tired.\n\n# Consider the case where Monkeypox is the \"glu\".\n# If a human has Monkeypox, then they experience the symptom of tiredness.\n# And if they experience the symptom of tiredness, this is akin to \"getting a glu\" in the sense of becoming tired.\n# This seems like an over-interpretation not directly supported by premises.\n\n# Let's re-examine the simplest interpretation and look for direct logical flaws or missing cases.\n# No apparent logical flaws or missing edge cases in the symptom list or virus occurrence.\n# The only area that might be simplified is the `FeelTiredWhen` and its relation to the symptom.\n\n# Proposal: Simplify the symptom of \"feeling tired\" by directly linking it to the state of being tired.\n# Instead of `FeelingTired(tiredness_symptom)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness_symptom, mp)`,\n# we can say `IsTired(x)` is a symptom of `mp`.\n# However, the predicates are given. So `FeelingTired(x)` is a predicate representing the *condition* of feeling tired.\n\n# Let's try to make the connection between the symptom and the cause explicit,\n# while adhering to the given predicates.\n# The problem states: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# And \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired.\"\n\n# If a person x has Monkeypox (OccurIn(mp, x)), and feeling tired is a symptom of Monkeypox,\n# then x experiences tiredness.\n# Let's introduce a predicate `ExperiencesSymptom(person, symptom)`\n# `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2227 OccurIn(mp, x) \u2192 ExperiencesSymptom(x, tiredness_condition))`\n# And then link `ExperiencesSymptom` to `FeelTiredWhen`.\n# `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2227 ExperiencesSymptom(x, tiredness_condition) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, glu_event))` (This still assumes tiredness implies a glu)\n\n# Alternative: Simplify the premise about 'glu'.\n# If \"feeling tired\" is a symptom, and people feel tired when they get a glu,\n# then perhaps the *symptom* of feeling tired is a type of 'glu' for humans.\n# This would require a definition: `\u2200x, c (SymptomOf(c, mp) \u2227 c = tiredness_condition \u2192 IsAGluFor(c, Human))`\n# This is also adding complexity.\n\n# The most straightforward simplification:\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is a specific instance of causing tiredness.\n# The symptom \"feeling tired\" is an instance of a state of tiredness.\n# If a human has Monkeypox, they *may* experience the symptom of feeling tired.\n# If a human gets a glu, they *will* feel tired.\n\n# Consider the original predicates: `FeelingTired(x)` is a predicate for the state.\n# `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` means x feels tired when they experience y.\n# The original code has `FeelingTired(tiredness_symptom)`.\n# And `SymptomOf(tiredness_symptom, mp)`.\n# And `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, a_glu))`.\n\n# What if we interpret `FeelingTired(x)` as an abstract concept, and `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` as a specific manifestation.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" directly uses `FeelTiredWhen`.\n# And \"feeling tired\" is a symptom.\n# Let's create a link: The symptom of feeling tired *is* a case of feeling tired.\n# `SymptomOf(tiredness_condition, mp)` means that `tiredness_condition` is a symptom.\n# We can imply that if `tiredness_condition` is a symptom, and `Human(x)` and `OccurIn(mp, x)`, then `x` experiences `tiredness_condition`.\n\n# Let's refine the premise about the glu to be more general.\n# Instead of a specific instance `a_glu`, let's represent a 'glu' as a type of condition.\n# `GluCondition(y)`: y is a condition that causes tiredness.\n# `\u2200x, y (Human(x) \u2227 GluCondition(y) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, y))`\n# And then, what is the relation between `tiredness_condition` and `GluCondition`?\n# If `tiredness_condition` is a symptom of MP, and `FeelingTired(x)` describes this state,\n# then `tiredness_condition` *is* a state of feeling tired.\n\n# Let's try a simplification by making the \"glu\" a category for things causing tiredness.\n# And the symptom of tiredness falls into that category.\n# This requires reinterpreting the 'glu' as a general cause type.\n\n# Let's stick to the predicates and try to simplify the reasoning flow.\n# The core relationship: MP -> Tiredness (symptom), Glu -> Tiredness (for humans).\n# We can make it explicit that a human experiencing the tiredness symptom of MP is indeed feeling tired.\n\n# New approach:\n# The symptom `FeelingTired` is a state.\n# The premise \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" links a cause (`glu`) to the state (`feeling tired`).\n# Let's represent the fact that a human having MP experiences the symptom of tiredness.\n# And that this experience is what is meant by \"feeling tired\".\n\n# Revised Premises:\n# Monkeypox and its properties\nMonkeypox(mp)\nInfectiousDisease(mp)\nCausedBy(mp, mp_virus)\nMonkeypoxVirus(mp_virus)\n\n# Virus occurrence\n# Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans.\n# Generalizing to all animals and specifically including humans.\n\u2200x (Animal(x) \u2192 OccurIn(mp_virus, x))\n\n# Animal hierarchy\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x))\n\u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\n\n# Symptoms of Monkeypox\n# Representing the symptoms as conditions.\nFever(fever_condition)\nHeadache(headache_condition)\nMusclePains(muscle_pains_condition)\nFeelingTired(tiredness_condition) #
