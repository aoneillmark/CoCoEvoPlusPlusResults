The use of `\u00acMoreThan(d, 1500)` from Parent B is equivalent to `LessThanOrEqual(d, 1500)` if we assume `LessThanOrEqual` is a standard predicate.

The core logic for the rent condition based on deposit amount is preserved from Parent A, as it correctly handles the numerical comparison with 1500. The use of `\u00acMoreThan(d, 1500)` from Parent B is equivalent to `LessThanOrEqual(d, 1500)` if we assume `LessThanOrEqual` is a standard predicate. We opt for `LessThanOrEqual` for clarity.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",

The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more. Fluffy is Tom's cat. Cats are pets. The Olive Garden is a managed building. The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000. Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. 2000$ is more than $1500.",
