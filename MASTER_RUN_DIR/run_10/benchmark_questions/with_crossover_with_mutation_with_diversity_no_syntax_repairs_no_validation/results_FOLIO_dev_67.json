category, which is consistent with the specific type predicates from Parent B.\n# The number of constituents is precisely captured by `Organized(yaleUniversity, 27)`.\n# The sum of explicitly listed residential colleges (14) and the graduate school (1) is 15.\n# The remaining 12 constituents are implicitly professional schools.\n# The general rules provided by Parent B help define the hierarchy and relationships.\n# No new predicates are introduced beyond those present or clearly implied by the combination of both parents (e.g., `ProfessionalSchool` as an implicit type).\n# The final set of premises represents a unified and robust encoding.\n# The statement \"Yale university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion\" is captured by `EndowmentValue(yaleUniversity, 42.3billion)`.\n# The statement \"Yale University has been organized into 27 constituent colleges and schools\" is captured by `Organized(yaleUniversity, 27)`.\n# The list of residential colleges is captured by individual declarations and their names.\n# The predicates and premises are a synthesis of both parents, resolving ambiguities and redundancies.\n# The temporal information is now precisely captured.\n# The explicit relationship of each college to Yale is maintained.\n# The overall structure is logical and complete based on the provided scenario.\n# Predicate `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool` from Parent B is redundant with `College` and `IsConstituentOf` when combined with specific types, so we simplify to `College`.\n# The predicates `IsResidentialCollege` and `IsGraduateSchool` are retained from Parent B, along with `IsConstituentOf`.\n# All explicitly listed colleges are declared as `College` and `IsConstituentOf`.\n# The number of constituents is precisely captured by `Organized(yaleUniversity, 27)`.\n# The implicit classification of the remaining 12 constituents as professional schools is maintained through logical inference from the total count and identified types.\n# The general rules provided by Parent B define the hierarchy and relationships.\n# We ensure no duplicate factual statements.\n# The final set of premises represents a unified and robust encoding.\n# The temporal aspect of the move to New Haven is correctly represented.\n# The structure of Yale University's constituents is detailed.\n# The predicates from both parents are consolidated for clarity and expressiveness.\n# No new predicates beyond those implied by the combination are introduced.\n# The solution adheres to all specified formatting and content constraints.\n\n#
