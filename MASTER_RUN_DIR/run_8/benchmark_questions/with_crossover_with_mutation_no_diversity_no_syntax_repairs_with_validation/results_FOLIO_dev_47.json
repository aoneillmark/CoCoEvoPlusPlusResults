However, it can be more explicit that\n# the set of students who want long vacations are a subset of those who love summer.\n# Since the problem states \"All students who want a long vacation love summer\",\n# and James wants a long vacation, James loves summer.\n# The premise \"All students who want a long vacation love summer\" is sufficient.\n\n# The information \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most\"\n# is interpreted as \"love summer\". The \"the most\" is captured by `FavoriteSeason`.\n# We don't have a predicate for \"loves the most\".\n\n# The premise \"Emma's favorite season is summer.\" is already encoded.\n# The premise \"Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.\"\n# implies that Mia's favorite season is not summer, since Emma's favorite season IS summer.\n# This is a direct consequence and can be simplified.\n# Original: \u2203s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2227 \u00acSummer(s))\n# This correctly states that there exists *some* season that is Mia's favorite, and that season is not summer.\n# If Mia's favorite season was Summer, then FavoriteSeason(mia, summer) would be true.\n# But since FavoriteSeason(mia, s) and s is not summer, it means Mia's favorite is not summer.\n\n# Simplify the premise about seasons being distinct.\n# The original logic for distinct seasons is overly complex.\n# If we declare Spring(), Summer(), Fall(), Winter() as distinct individuals,\n# then we don't need to assert their distinctness using quantification over arbitrary s1, s2.\n# The standard way to handle this is to introduce distinct individuals.\n# Let's redefine the seasons as unique individuals.\n# This implies that Spring() is a declaration of an individual named Spring.\n\n# Revised Premises:\n# Declare the seasons as distinct individuals.\n# This implicitly makes them distinct and of type Season.\n# We can also add an axiom to ensure that if something is Spring, it is a Season.\n# And that only one season can be Spring, etc.\n\n# Let's revert to the previous approach of asserting the existence of seasons and then defining Season(x).\n# The distinctness can be asserted directly as done in the original program,\n# or by asserting that each season is *not* the other seasons.\n\n# Re-evaluating the distinct seasons premise:\n# Original:\n# \u2200s1 \u2200s2 ( (Spring(s1) \u2228 Summer(s1) \u2228 Fall(s1) \u2228 Winter(s1)) \u2227 (Spring(s2) \u2228 Summer(s2) \u2228 Fall(s2)

premise is asserting that if s1 and s2 are seasons, then s1=s2 if and only if they are the same specific season.\n# A simpler way to assert distinctness of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter is:\n# \u00acSpring(Summer())\n# \u00acSpring(Fall())\n# ... etc.\n# Or more generally:\n# \u2200s1 \u2200s2 (Season(s1) \u2227 Season(s2) \u2227 s1 \u2260 s2 \u2192 \u00ac(s1=s2)) -- This is tautological if s1 and s2 are distinct names.\n# The intent is that Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter are distinct entities.\n# The original premise is a very verbose way of saying that if s1 and s2 are seasons, then they are equal if and only if they are the same specific season.\n\n# A simpler and more common way to assert distinctness of declared individuals:\n# Spring()\n# Summer()\n# Fall()\n# Winter()\n# \u2200s

implies that Spring() is a declaration of an individual named Spring.\n\n# Revised Premises:\n# Declare the seasons as distinct individuals.\n# This implicitly makes them distinct and of type Season.\n# We can also add an axiom to ensure that if something is Spring, it is a Season.\n# And that only one season can be Spring, etc.\n\n# Let's revert to the previous approach of asserting the
