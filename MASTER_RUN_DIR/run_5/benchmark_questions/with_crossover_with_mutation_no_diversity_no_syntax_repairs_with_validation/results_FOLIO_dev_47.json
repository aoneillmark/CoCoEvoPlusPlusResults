James wants a long vacation.\n# 4. Students wanting long vacations love summer.\n# 5. Emma's favorite season is summer.\n# 6. Mia's favorite season is one of Spring, Fall, or Winter.\n# 7. Any favorite season implies love for that season.\n\n# This set of premises fully captures the scenario and is slightly more explicit\n# about Mia's favorite season.\n\n# Removing the now redundant premise:\n# \u2200m_fav_season.

spring \u2228 s = summer \u2228 s = fall \u2228 s = winter)) is more accurate.\n# Let's use the first premise to define all seasons and then use the constants.\n# So, we'll redefine the season

If they are not used for any explicit logical deduction or constraint within the problem, they can be removed to simplify.\n# The problem statement does not ask any questions that require reasoning about a specific year or the seasons it contains, beyond defining what the seasons are.\n# Therefore, the premises related to `Year()` and `HasSeason()` might be extraneous for the given problem and can be removed for simplification.\n\n# Let's assume the prompt wants a *different* encoding while fixing bugs/edge cases/simplifying.\n# The current encoding is quite good. Let's focus on alternative phrasing or structure if possible, while maintaining correctness.\n\n# Alternative interpretation for \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most.\"\n# This could imply that if a student wants a long vacation, then Summer is their favorite season AND for any other season S, they do not like S more than Summer.\n# However, the simpler interpretation of \"favorite season is Summer\" is usually sufficient and the most direct.\n# The current encoding `FavoriteSeason(x, summer)` captures this directly.\n\n# Let's try to simplify by using the fact that seasons are distinct.\n# The statement `\u2200s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2192 \u00ac(s = summer))` is already quite direct.\n# We know that Mia *must* have a favorite season, as implied by `FavoriteSeason(mia, s)`.\n# If we want to be more explicit that Mia *has* a favorite season, and it's one of the other three:\n# \u2203s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2227 s \u2260 summer)\n# And further, if we want to specify it's one of Spring, Fall, or Winter:\n# \u2203s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2227 (s = spring \u2228 s = fall \u2228 s = winter))\n# This is more specific than `\u2200s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2192 \u00ac(s = summer))`.\n# The current premise `\u2200s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2192 \u00ac(s = summer))` only states what Mia's favorite season is NOT. It doesn't guarantee she *has* a favorite season.\n# To ensure Mia has a favorite season, we need a premise like: `\u2203s FavoriteSeason(mia, s)`.\n# And combining that with the exclusion:\n# `\u2203s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2227 (s = spring \u2228 s = fall \u2228 s = winter))`\n# This is a good addition for edge cases.\n\n# Let's refine the premises based on this.\n\n# Defining the seasons as distinct entities\nSpring(spring)\nSummer(summer)\nFall(fall)\nWinter(winter)\n\n# There are exactly four seasons in a year.\n\u2200s (Season(s) \u2194 (s = spring \u2228 s = summer \u2228 s = fall \u2228 s = winter))\n\n# Identifying the individuals as students\nStudent(emma)\nStudent(mia)\nStudent(james)\n\n# Emma's favorite season is Summer.\nFavoriteSeason(emma, summer)\n\n# Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.\n# Since Emma's favorite season is Summer, Mia's favorite season is not Summer.\n# To ensure Mia *has* a favorite season and it's one of the remaining ones.\n# This makes the logic more complete by ensuring Mia has a favorite season.\n\u2203s (FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2227 (s = spring \u2228 s = fall \u2228 s = winter))\n# This implies FavoriteSeason(mia, s) is true for some s, and for all s where FavoriteSeason(mia, s) is true, s cannot be summer.\n# So this single premise covers both: Mia has a favorite season, and it's not Summer.\n\n# James wants a long vacation.\nWantsLongVacation(james)\n\n# All students who want a long vacation love summer the most.\n# This means that if a student wants a long vacation, their favorite season is Summer.\n\u2200s (Student(s) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(s) \u2192 FavoriteSeason(s, summer))\n\n# The premises about Year() and HasSeason() are not strictly necessary for the deductions based on the provided text, so they are omitted for simplification.\n# The core information is about seasons, students, their preferences, and desires for vacation.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(FavoriteSeason(mia, spring) \u2228 FavoriteSeason(mia, fall) \u2228 FavoriteSeason(mia, winter)) \u2227 \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer)\n",
