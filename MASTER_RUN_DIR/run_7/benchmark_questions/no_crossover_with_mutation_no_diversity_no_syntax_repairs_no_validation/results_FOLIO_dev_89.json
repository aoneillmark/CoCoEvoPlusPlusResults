If Harry could \"gain\" something non-knowledge, they wouldn't become smarter.\n#   However, the phrasing \"gains knowledge\" in the scenario description strongly implies this connection.\n\n# Let's aim for a more precise and less ambiguous set of axioms that still captures the scenario.\n\n# Refined Premises:\n# Entities: Person, Book, Knowledge, String (for titles)\n# Relationships: Author(person, book), Title(book, string), Reads(person, book), Contains(book, knowledge), Gains(person, knowledge), Smarter(person)\n\n# Axioms:\n# 1.

If Harry could \"read\" a non-book and gain knowledge, that might be unintended.\n#   However, given `Reads(harry, walden)` and `Book(walden)`, this is handled in this instance.\n# - Axiom 3: `Gains(x, y)` doesn't specify that `y` is knowledge. If Harry could \"gain\" something non-knowledge, they wouldn't become smarter.\n#   However, the phrasing \"gains knowledge\" in the scenario description strongly implies this connection.\n\n# Let's aim for a more precise and less ambiguous set of axioms that still captures the scenario.\n\n# Refined Premises:\n# Entities: Person, Book, Knowledge, String (for titles)\n# Relationships: Author(person, book), Title(book, string), Reads(person, book), Contains(book, knowledge), Gains(person, knowledge), Smarter(person)\n\n# Axioms:\n# 1.
