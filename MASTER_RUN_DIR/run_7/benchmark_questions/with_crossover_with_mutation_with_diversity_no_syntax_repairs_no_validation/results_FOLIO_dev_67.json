constituent units.\n# For professional schools, we assert the count as given.\n# The total count of 27 is already asserted by Organized(yaleUniversity, 27).\n# We can infer that there exist 12

Parent A, the professional schools were represented with a universal quantification over an index, which implies existence.\n# In Parent B, the professional schools are represented by their count, also implying existence.\n# We can combine these by asserting the count and the existence of such schools.\n# The prompt does not provide names for these 12 professional schools, so they are not listed individually.\n# The assertion 'Organized(yaleUniversity, 27)' covers the total number of constituents.\n# The prompt's breakdown (14 residential colleges + 1 graduate school + 12 professional schools = 27) provides context for this total.\n# We can ensure that each of the 14 named residential colleges and the graduate school are indeed considered constituent units, which is covered by the 'ConstituentUnit' predicate applied to each.\n# The phrasing \"organized into 27 constituent colleges and schools\" implies that all listed entities are constituent colleges and schools.\n# The predicates `IsResidentialCollege`, `IsGraduateSchool`, and the existence of `NumberOfProfessionalSchools` help categorize these constituents.\n# To reflect the explicit naming of residential colleges as constituents in Parent B, we ensure `ConstituentUnit` and `PartOf` are present for them.\n# This is already done by combining them with `IsResidentialCollege` and `Name`.\n# The `Organized(yaleUniversity, 27)` premise already covers the total count.\n# The individual premises for each residential college and the graduate school already assert their status as constituent units.\n# We maintain `NumberOfProfessionalSchools(yaleUniversity, 12)` to reflect the explicit mention of \"twelve professional schools\" in the scenario.\n# This ensures consistency with the total count of 27.\n# The specific breakdown of constituents (14 residential, 1 graduate, 12 professional) is important for understanding the composition of the 27.\n# We have explicitly listed the 14 residential colleges, their names, their type, and that they are part of Yale.\n# We have explicitly listed the graduate school, its name, its type, and that it is part of Yale.\n# We have asserted the count of professional schools.\n# The combined premises correctly represent the information from both parents and the scenario.\n\n# Conclusion:\nConstituent(piersonCollege, yale) \u2227
