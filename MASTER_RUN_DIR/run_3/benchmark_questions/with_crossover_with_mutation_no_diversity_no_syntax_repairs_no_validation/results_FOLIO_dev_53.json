The latter is the contrapositive of\n#    `\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(x))` and is thus redundant. The former is too specific.\n# 2. The premise `\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00ac(x = french) \u2228 \u00ac(x = spanish))` is incorrect. It states\n#    that a Romance language cannot be both French and Spanish, which is true, but it's better\n#    to define French and Spanish as distinct entities. The individual facts `French(french)` and\n#    `Spanish(spanish)` are sufficient for grounding.\n# 3. The premise `\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (BelongsToFamily(x, z) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(y, z) \u2192 Related(x, y))` is good.\n#    We need to ensure that Romance languages belong to *a* family.\n# 4.

The premise \"\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(x))\" is good.\n# 4. The premise \"\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 BelongsToFamily(x, RomanceFamily))\" and \"BelongsToFamily(French, RomanceFamily)\", \"BelongsToFamily(Spanish, RomanceFamily)\" establish that French and Spanish are in the RomanceFamily.\n# 5. The premise \"\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (BelongsToFamily(x, y) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(z, y) \u2192 Related(x, z))\" establishes that if two languages are in the same family, they are related.

The premise \"Related(German, Spanish)\" is a direct fact.\n\n# Let's combine and refine:\n\n# Remove direct instantiations of RomanceLanguage for French and Spanish and rely on implications.\n# Instead of RomanceLanguage(French), use \u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x)). This is already present.\n# Keep RomanceLanguage(French) and RomanceLanguage(Spanish) as direct facts if they are meant to be atomic truths. The original program has both. Let's keep them.\n\n# Revised approach:\n# Focus on minimal, non-redundant premises that capture all information.\n\n# The prompt asks for a *new* program, different from the current one, that satisfies the same problem.\n# The current program has some redundancies like:\n# RomanceLanguage(French) and \u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))\n# RomanceLanguage(Spanish) and \u2200x (Spanish(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))\n# If French(French) is true, then RomanceLanguage(French) is implied by the second.\n# Let's assume French, Spanish, German, Basque are individuals and not predicates in the typical sense.\n# If they are individuals, then the original premises are fine.\n# Let's reinterpret the original program's intent: French, Spanish, German, Basque are specific languages.\n\n# The goal is to fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\n# A potential issue: the definition of \"Related(x,y)\" could be symmetric. The current definition doesn't enforce it.\n# If x is related to y, is y related to x? Typically, yes.\n\n# Let's introduce symmetry for Related.\n\n# Let's also ensure that if a language is Romance, it is indeed a Language.\n# The original program has:\n# \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n# This is good to keep for clarity, even if implied by other rules.\n\n# Edge case: What if RomanceFamily itself is not a language?\n# The scenario states \"The Romance languages are a language family.\" This implies RomanceFamily is a LanguageFamily.\n\n# Let's reformulate slightly to be more concise while capturing all facts.\n\n# Remove redundant declarations:\n# RomanceLanguage(French) is redundant if \u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x)) is present and French is French.\n# However, if 'French' is treated as an atomic individual constant, then RomanceLanguage(French) is a direct assertion.\n# The prompt does not specify if French, Spanish etc. are individual constants or variables.\n# Given the original structure, it's likely they are individual constants.\n# So, `RomanceLanguage(French)` is an assertion that French *is* a Romance Language.\n# And `\u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))` implies that *if something is French*, it is a Romance Language. This is slightly different.\n# Let's assume `French`, `Spanish`, `German`, `Basque` are individual constants representing those languages.\n# Then `French(French)` would be true.\n# The original program uses `French(x)` as a predicate. This means `French` is not an individual constant, but a predicate name.\n# So `RomanceLanguage(French)` is likely a typo and should be `RomanceLanguage(FrenchConstant)` if French is an individual.\n# However, the prompt states \"Generally keep the same vocabulary\". The vocabulary includes `French(x)`.\n# Let's assume `French`, `Spanish`, `German`, `Basque` are predicates that identify a specific language.\n# So `RomanceLanguage(French)` means \"The language that is French is a Romance Language\".

The current definition doesn't enforce it.\n# If x is related to y, is y related to x? Typically, yes.\n\n# Let's introduce symmetry for Related.\n\n# Let's also ensure that if a language is Romance, it is indeed a Language.\n# The original program has:\n# \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n# This is good to keep for clarity, even if implied by other rules.\n\n# Edge case: What if RomanceFamily itself is not a language?\n# The scenario states \"The Romance languages are a language family.\" This implies RomanceFamily is a LanguageFamily.\n\n# Let's reformulate slightly to be more concise while capturing all facts.\n\n# Remove redundant declarations:\n# RomanceLanguage(French) is redundant if \u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x)) is present and French is French.\n# However, if 'French' is treated as an atomic individual constant, then RomanceLanguage(French) is a direct assertion.\n# The prompt does not specify if French, Spanish etc. are individual constants or variables.\n# Given the original structure, it's likely they are individual constants.\n# So, `RomanceLanguage(French)` is an assertion that French *is* a Romance Language.\n# And `\u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))` implies that *if something is French*, it is a Romance Language. This is slightly different.\n# Let's assume `French`, `Spanish`, `German`, `Basque` are individual constants representing those languages.\n# Then `French(French)` would be true.\n# The original program uses `French(x)` as a predicate. This means `French` is not an individual constant, but a predicate name.\n# So `RomanceLanguage(French)` is likely a typo and should be `RomanceLanguage(FrenchConstant)` if French is an individual.\n# However, the prompt states \"Generally keep the same vocabulary\".
