Aurochs -> Animal. Correct.\n# 6. SelectiveBreeding of domestic animals implies that if something is bred back, it's a domestic animal.\n#    `\u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 DomesticAnimal(x))`. This is a reasonable interpretation from the definition.\n# 7. Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals. `\u2203x (ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 Animal(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))`.\n#    By adding `ToBreedBack(heckCattleBreed)`, this premise is satisfied by the Heck Cattle example.\n\n# The phrasing \"domestic animals\" in the definition of SelectiveBreeding implies the *subjects* of this breeding activity are domestic.\n# Therefore, if an animal is a product of breeding back (which implies selective breeding), it must be a domestic animal.\n# This is `\u2200x (BreedingBack(x) \u2192 DomesticAnimal(x))`.\n# And since `HeckCattle` are an example of something that was bred back, they are domestic.\n# So, `\u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 DomesticAnimal(x))` is a consequence, and also a reasonable assertion given the context.\n# The current premises appear to cover the scenario well.\n\n# One potential simplification/refinement:\n# The statement \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s\" can be interpreted as `BreedingBack(heckCattleBreed)`.\n# If `BredBack(x, y)` implies `BreedingBack(x)`, then the premises are consistent.\n# Let's explicitly assert `BreedingBack(heckCattleBreed)`.\nBreedingBack(heckCattleBreed) # Heck cattle breed is an example of 'breeding back'.\n\n# If `BreedingBack(heckCattleBreed)` is true, then:\n# `ArtificialSelection(heckCattleBreed)` is true.\n# `SelectiveBreeding(heckCattleBreed)` is true.\n# `DomesticAnimal(heckCattleBreed)` is true.\n\n# The original program used `BredBack(heckCattleBreed, year1920s)` which is a statement about a historical event.\n# `BreedingBack(x)` is a predicate that could mean \"x is a process of breeding back\" or \"x is an entity that is a result of breeding back\".\n# Given the context \"Breeding back is a form of...\", it refers to the phenomenon/process.\n# If `heckCattleBreed` represents the *breed*, then `BreedingBack(heckCattleBreed)` means this breed is a result of breeding back.\n# This seems a more direct interpretation aligned with the definition.\n\n# Let's ensure the predicates align with the intended meaning:\n# `BreedingBack(x)`: x is a breed or type of animal that is the result of breeding back.\n# `BredBack(x, y)`: animal x was historically caused to be bred back in year y.\n# If `heckCattleBreed` represents the breed, then `BreedingBack(heckCattleBreed)` is appropriate.\n# And `BredBack(heckCattleBreed, year1920s)` refers to the specific historical event.\n# The relationship between `BreedingBack` and `BredBack` might be: if `BredBack(x, y)` for some y, then `BreedingBack(x)`.\n# This is a reasonable inference.\n\n# Let's refine the premises to reflect this:\n# Premise 1: If an animal breed/type is `BredBack` in any year, it is a `BreedingBack` breed/type.\n\u2200x \u2200y (BredBack(x, y) \u2192 BreedingBack(x))\n\n# This implies `BreedingBack(heckCattleBreed)` from `BredBack(heckCattleBreed, year1920s)`.\n# The rest of the logic then follows. This makes the connection more explicit and general.\n\n# The prompt asks to fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\n# The core logic is mostly sound, but the connection between `BredBack` (historical event) and `BreedingBack` (the phenomenon)\n# could be made more explicit.\n\n# Final set of premises:\n# Definition of breeding back.\n\u2200x (BreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x))\n\u2200x (ArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x))\n\n# Heck cattle are animals and were bred back.\nHeckCattle(heckCattleBreed)\n\u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\nBredBack(heckCattleBreed, year1920s)\n\n# If an animal breed/type was historically bred back, it is a result of breeding back.\n\u2200x \u2200y (BredBack(x, y) \u2192 BreedingBack(x))\n\n# Breeding back is a form of selective breeding of domestic animals.\n# This implies any animal that is a result of breeding back is a domestic animal.\n\u2200x (BreedingBack(x) \u2192 DomesticAnimal(x))\n\n# Heck cattle were bred back to resemble the aurochs species.\nAurochs(aurochsSpecies)\nAnimal(aurochsSpecies)\nExtinct(aurochsSpecies)\n\u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Resemble(x, aurochsSpecies))\n\n# Aurochs are animals.\n\u2200x (Aurochs(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\n\n# Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.\n# `ToBreedBack(x)` means x is an animal that is the subject of a breeding back effort.\n# The historical event `BredBack(heckCattleBreed, year1920s)` implies that `heckCattleBreed` was subject to this process.\nToBreedBack(heckCattleBreed)\n\u2203x (ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 Animal(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))\n# This premise is satisfied by `heckCattleBreed` and `aurochsSpecies`.\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
