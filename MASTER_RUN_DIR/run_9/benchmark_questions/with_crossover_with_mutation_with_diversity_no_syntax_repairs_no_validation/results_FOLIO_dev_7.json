and `d` is Monkeypox,\n# and a person `p` has Monkeypox, then `s` is a symptom for `p`.\n# This is implicitly handled by the definition of SymptomOf, but let's ensure we can reason about a person

is a symptom of Monkeypox, then any person with Monkeypox will exhibit `FeelingTired`.\n# The link between `FeelingTired` and `Person` is established by the \"glu\" premise.\n# The current premises already state `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`.\n# And that `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` can occur for any `Person(p)` and `Glu(g)`.\n# We need to ensure `FeelingTired` can be a symptom experienced

due to Monkeypox.\n# The `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` premise is a separate cause for feeling tired.\n# We need to ensure that `FeelingTired` as a symptom of `Monkeypox` leads to a person feeling tired.\n# This is implicitly covered by the definition of \"SymptomOf\".\n# If `FeelingTired` is a symptom of Monkeypox, then a person infected with Monkeypox will experience `FeelingTired`.\n\n# Re-emphasizing the connection:\n# FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# Monkeypox virus occurs in humans.\n# Therefore, a human infected with Monkeypox will experience FeelingTired.\n# The `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)`

As a symptom of Monkeypox (\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)))\n# 2. Due to having Glu in persons (\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasGlu(p) \u2192 FeelingTired(p)))\n\n# Given the prompt is to fix bugs, add edge-cases, or simplify logic while keeping the same vocabulary:\n# 1. Bug Fix/Clarification: The original premises `\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(Fever, x))` etc. are problematic. `SymptomOf(Fever, x)` means Fever is a symptom of `x`. If `x` is Monkeypox, then Fever is a symptom *of Monkeypox*. This is semantically correct but could be clearer if interpreted as \"if a person has Monkeypox, they experience Fever\". The current phrasing implies Fever is a symptom *of the disease itself*, not necessarily *in a person*. We will keep it as is, assuming this is the intended interpretation.\n\n# 2. Missing Edge Cases: The problem states \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" This implies a causal link specific to people. The original premises also state `\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x))`. It's not explicitly stated that this symptom is only relevant for humans. However, given the context of humans and Monkeypox, it's reasonable to assume the symptom applies to people.\n\n# 3. Simplification: The explicit rule for humans having glu `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2227 HasGlu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` is a direct consequence of `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))` and `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 HasGlu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`.

This applies to any instance of Monkeypox.\n# If a person contracts Monkeypox, they will experience FeelingTired.\n# The original formulation `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)` implies FeelingTired is a property of `x`.\n# To make it clearer that this applies to individuals experiencing Monkeypox:\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasMonkeypox(p) \u2192 FeelingTired(p)).\n# However, 'HasMonkeypox(p)' is not a defined predicate.\n# Let's stick to the original structure and infer the application to persons.\n# If 'mp' is an instance of Monkeypox, then FeelingTired is a symptom of 'mp'.\n\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)).\n\n# Causes of Feeling Tired for a Person\n# People feel tired when they get a glu.\n# We use `HasGlu(p)` to denote that person `p` has glu.\n\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasGlu(p) \u2192 FeelingTired(p)).\n# Humans are persons.\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x)).\n\n# The presence of Monkeypox implies FeelingTired as a symptom.\n# The presence of Glu (for a person) also implies FeelingTired.

As a symptom of Monkeypox (\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)))\n# 2. Due to having Glu in persons (\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasGlu(p) \u2192 FeelingTired(p)))\n\n# Given the prompt is to fix bugs, add edge-cases, or simplify logic while keeping the same vocabulary:\n# 1. Bug Fix/Clarification: The original premises `\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(Fever, x))` etc. are problematic. `SymptomOf(Fever, x)` means Fever is a symptom of `x`. If `x` is Monkeypox, then Fever is a symptom *of Monkeypox*. This is semantically correct but could be clearer if interpreted as \"if a person has Monkeypox, they experience Fever\". The current phrasing implies Fever is a symptom *of the disease itself*, not necessarily *in a person*. We will keep it as is, assuming this is the intended interpretation.\n\n# 2. Missing Edge Cases: The problem states \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" This implies a causal link specific to people. The original premises also state `\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x))`. It's not explicitly stated that this symptom is only relevant for humans. However, given the context of humans and Monkeypox, it's reasonable to assume the symptom applies to people.\n\n# 3. Simplification: The explicit rule for humans having glu `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2227 HasGlu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` is a direct consequence of `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))` and `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 HasGlu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`. This redundant rule can be removed for simplification.\n\n# Revised Premises (incorporating simplifications and minor clarifications):\n\n# Monkeypox properties\nMonkeypox(mpox).\nInfectiousDisease(mpox).\nCausedBy(mpox, mpox_virus).\nMonkeypoxVirus(mpox_virus).\n\n# Occurrences of Monkeypox Virus\n# Monkeypox virus occurs in animals.\nOccurIn(mpox_virus, animals).\n# Humans are a type of animal.\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Animal(x)).\n# Therefore, the monkeypox virus can occur in humans.\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 OccurIn(mpox_virus, x)).\n\n# Hierarchies\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x)).\n\u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x)).\n\n# Symptoms of Monkeypox\n# Feeling tired is a symptom of Monkeypox. This applies to any instance of Monkeypox.\n# If a person contracts Monkeypox, they will experience FeelingTired.\n# The original formulation `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)` implies FeelingTired is a property of `x`.\n# To make it clearer that this applies to individuals experiencing Monkeypox:\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasMonkeypox(p) \u2192 FeelingTired(p)).\n# However, 'HasMonkeypox(p)' is not a defined predicate.\n# Let's stick to the original structure and infer the application to persons.\n# If 'mp' is an instance of Monkeypox, then FeelingTired is a symptom of 'mp'.\n\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)).\n\n# Causes of Feeling Tired for a Person\n# People feel tired when they get a glu.\n# We use `HasGlu(p)` to denote that person `p` has glu.\n\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasGlu(p) \u2192 FeelingTired(p)).\n# Humans are persons.\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x)).\n\n# The presence of Monkeypox implies FeelingTired as a symptom.\n# The presence of Glu (for a person) also implies FeelingTired.

Let's simplify this to a direct implication using the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate:\n# For every person `p`, and for every `glu` `g`, if `p` experiences `g`, then `p` feels tired.\n# The predicate `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` implies that `p` feels tired when `g` occurs.\n# So, if we establish that `g` is a `Glu`, and `p` is a `Person`, and `p` experiences `g`, then `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)`.\n# The original prompt implies a direct causal link between a person and a glu leading to tiredness.\n# A simplified translation assuming 'Glu' is a generic cause of tiredness for people:\n# For any person `p` and any `glu` `g`, if `p` is affected by `g`, then `p` feels tired.\n# Using the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate directly:\n# For all `p`, `Person(p)` implies (For all `g`, `Glu(g)` implies `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)`)\n# This implies that if something is a 'Glu', and someone is a 'Person', they will feel tired if they get it.\n# Assuming 'Glu' is a type of condition that can be

handled by `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)`.\n# If Monkeypox is a specific disease that can affect a person, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox,\n# then a person infected with Monkeypox might feel tired.\n# If Monkeypox itself can be considered a \"glu\" in a broader sense:\n# For any person `p`, if `Monkeypox(mp)` and `OccurIn(mp, p)`, then `p` feels tired.\n# However, the prompt links feeling tired specifically to \"glu\", not generally to all diseases.\n# The most direct interpretation of the provided information without introducing new predicates is:\n# If a person `p` has `Monkeypox`, and `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`,\n# then `p` can experience `FeelingTired`.\n# And if `FeelingTired` is caused by something that can be considered a 'glu', this part of the rule applies.\n# The current premise `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` is a general rule.\n# Monkeypox can cause the symptom of feeling tired.\n# So, if a person has Monkeypox, and Monkeypox can be thought of as a cause of feeling tired,\n# then the person feels tired.\n# The implication is that if `Monkeypox` causes the symptom `FeelingTired`, and a person has `Monkeypox`,\n# then that person will feel tired.\n# This is already captured by `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)`.\n# The `FeelTiredWhen` predicate is specifically tied to \"glu\".\n# So if Monkeypox is *not* a \"glu\", this specific rule might not apply directly.\n# However, if we interpret \"glu\" broadly as any ailment causing tiredness, then Monkeypox could be a \"glu\".\n# Let's assume for this encoding that `Monkeypox` itself is not an instance of `Glu`.\n# The rule is about `Glu` and general people.\n# The symptom `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`.\n# So, `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)`.\n# And `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)`.\n# To connect Monkeypox to feeling tired through the \"glu\" mechanism, we would need to say Monkeypox causes a 'glu'.\n# Or that Monkeypox itself is a 'glu'.\n# Without further information or predicates, the direct connection is missing if \"glu\" is a specific thing distinct from Monkeypox.\n# However, the sentence structure \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is general.\n# And \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\" is also general.\n# The most direct interpretation linking these is that *if* a person has Monkeypox, they might experience symptoms, including feeling tired.\n# The current model correctly states FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The link to \"glu\" is a separate, general rule about people.\n# If the intention is that Monkeypox *is* a 'glu' that makes people tired, we would need a premise like:\n# Monkeypox(x) -> Glu(x)\n# This is not explicitly stated.\n# Sticking to the given premises and scenario information:\n# The virus occurs in humans. Humans can get Monkeypox. Monkeypox causes feeling tired.\n# The rule `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` implies that if a person gets *any* 'glu', they feel tired.\n# This rule is generally true about people.\n# The symptom `FeelingTired` is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# This implies that if someone has Monkeypox, they can feel tired.\n# The connection to \"glu\" is only present if Monkeypox is considered a type of \"glu\", or if \"glu\" is a direct cause *of* Monkeypox.\n# The scenario states: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" This is a general rule.\n# The most we can directly assert is that FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The encoding of `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` is correct for the stated rule.\n# No further explicit connections are required unless \"glu\" is defined in relation to Monkeypox.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (Human(x) \u2227 Glu(x))\n",

can model \"get a glu\" as being affected by 'Glu'.\n# If 'Glu' is a condition or illness:\n# For any person `p` and any condition `g` that is a `Glu`, if `p` has `g`, then `p` feels tired.\n# Given the predicate `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)`, where `x` is the entity feeling tired and `y` is the cause.\n# The premise is \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This means: For any person `p` and any instance `g` of `Glu`, `p` feels tired because of `g`.\n# Simplest interpretation given predicates:\n# For any person `p`, if there exists a `glu` `g` such that `p` gets `g`, then `p` feels tired.\n# Let's simplify this to a direct implication using the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate:\n# For every person `p`, and for every `glu` `g`, if `p` experiences `g`, then `p` feels tired.\n# The predicate `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` implies that `p` feels tired when `g` occurs.\n# So, if we establish that `g` is a `Glu`, and `p` is a `Person`, and `p` experiences `g`, then `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)`.\n# The original prompt implies a direct causal link between a person and a glu leading to tiredness.\n# A simplified translation assuming 'Glu' is a generic cause of tiredness for people:\n# For any person `p` and any `glu` `g`, if `p` is affected by `g`, then `p` feels tired.\n# Using the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate directly:\n# For all `p`, `Person(p)` implies (For all `g`, `Glu(g)` implies `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)`)\n# This implies that if something is a 'Glu', and someone is a 'Person', they will feel tired if they get it.\n# Assuming 'Glu' is a type of condition that can be \"gotten\".\nPerson(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)\n\n# Monkeypox virus occurs in humans, and humans are animals.\n# The virus can occur in humans.\nOccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Humans)\n# The virus can occur in animals.\nOccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Animals)\n\n# If a person gets Monkeypox, they are affected by Monkeypox.\n# And Monkeypox has symptoms, including feeling tired.\n# This is implicitly handled by `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)`.\n# If Monkeypox is a specific disease that can affect a person, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox,\n# then a person infected with Monkeypox might feel tired.\n# If Monkeypox itself can be considered a \"glu\" in a broader sense:\n# For any person `p`, if `Monkeypox(mp)` and `OccurIn(mp, p)`, then `p` feels tired.\n# However, the prompt links feeling tired specifically to \"glu\", not generally to all diseases.\n# The most direct interpretation of the provided information without introducing new predicates is:\n# If a person `p` has `Monkeypox`, and `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`,\n# then `p` can experience `FeelingTired`.\n# And if `FeelingTired` is caused by something that can be considered a 'glu', this part of the rule applies.\n# The current premise `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` is a general rule.\n# Monkeypox can cause the symptom of feeling tired.\n# So, if a person has Monkeypox, and Monkeypox can be thought of as a cause of feeling tired,\n# then the person feels tired.\n# The implication is that if `Monkeypox` causes the symptom `FeelingTired`, and a person has `Monkeypox`,\n# then that person will feel tired.\n# This is already captured by `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)`.\n# The `FeelTiredWhen` predicate is specifically tied to \"glu\".\n# So if Monkeypox is *not* a \"glu\", this specific rule might not apply directly.\n# However, if we interpret \"glu\" broadly as any ailment causing tiredness, then Monkeypox could be a \"glu\".\n# Let's assume for this encoding that `Monkeypox` itself is not an instance of `Glu`.\n# The rule is about `Glu` and general people.\n# The symptom `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`.\n# So, `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)`.\n# And `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)`.\n# To connect Monkeypox to feeling tired through the \"glu\" mechanism, we would need to say Monkeypox causes a 'glu'.\n# Or that Monkeypox itself is a 'glu'.\n# Without further information or predicates, the direct connection is missing if \"glu\" is a specific thing distinct from Monkeypox.\n# However, the sentence structure \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is general.\n# And \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\" is also general.\n# The most direct interpretation linking these is that *if* a person has Monkeypox, they might experience symptoms, including feeling tired.\n# The current model correctly states FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The link to \"glu\" is a separate, general rule about people.\n# If the intention is that Monkeypox *is* a 'glu' that makes people tired, we would need a premise like:\n# Monkeypox(x) -> Glu(x)\n# This is not explicitly stated.\n# Sticking to the given premises and scenario information:\n# The virus occurs in humans. Humans can get Monkeypox. Monkeypox causes feeling tired.\n# The rule `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` implies that if a person gets *any* 'glu', they feel tired.\n# This rule is generally true about people.\n# The symptom `FeelingTired` is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# This implies that if someone has Monkeypox, they can feel tired.\n# The connection to \"glu\" is only present if Monkeypox is considered a type of \"glu\", or if \"glu\" is a direct cause *of* Monkeypox.\n# The scenario states: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" This is a general rule.\n# The most we can directly assert is that FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The encoding of `Person(p) & Glu(g) -> FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` is correct for the stated rule.\n# No further explicit connections are required unless \"glu\" is defined in relation to Monkeypox.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",
