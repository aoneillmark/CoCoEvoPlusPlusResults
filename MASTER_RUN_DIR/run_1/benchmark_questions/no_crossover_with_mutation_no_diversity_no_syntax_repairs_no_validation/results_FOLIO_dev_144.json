This is what it was defined as.\n# The statement \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs\" is a compound statement.\n# It implies:\n# 1. Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s. `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)`\n# 2. The purpose or result of this breeding back was resemblance to aurochs.\n\n# To capture the \"to resemble\" part:\n# Let's define `ResemblanceGoal(event, target)`\n# Let `BreedingBackEvent(event)`\n# `SubjectOfEvent(event, x)`\n# `YearOfEvent(event, y)`\n\n# Sticking to original predicates as much as possible.\n# Let's modify the `BredBack` predicate's interpretation slightly.\n# `BredBack(x, y)`: x was bred back in year y.\n# The problem states: \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.\"\n# This implies a connection between the act of breeding back and the resemblance.\n# Let's infer that the original `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` is a factual statement about the event.\n# And `\u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Resemble(x, aurochs))` describes the outcome.\n\n# To link them, we can state that if an entity `x` is HeckCattle, and `x` was subject to breeding back that aimed for resemblance to `y`, then `x` resembles `y`.\n\n# Let's use a new predicate `BreedingBackToResemble(x, y, year)` which means \"x was bred back to resemble y in year\".\n# This can simplify the encoding significantly.\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
