It's better to have the explicit statement.\n# Original premise: \u2200c (Created(c, theLegendOfZelda) \u2192 Japanese(c)) is redundant given the premise `Japanese(Nintendo)` and `Created(Nintendo, theLegendOfZelda)` and the general rule `\u2200g (Top10(g) \u2192 \u2203c (Created(c, g) \u2227 Japanese(c)))`. However, to ensure the company *that created* Zelda is Japanese specifically because it's Zelda (and not just because it's Top 10, if it were), this premise could be useful in some contexts.
