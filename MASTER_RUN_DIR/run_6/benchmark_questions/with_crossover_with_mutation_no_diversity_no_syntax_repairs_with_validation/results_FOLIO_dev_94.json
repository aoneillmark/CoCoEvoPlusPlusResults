This means 'a' is treated as both apartment and building.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the original formulation.\n# The original premise is: \u2200a (Rent(tom, a) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(a) \u2227 AllowedPet(fluffy, a) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(a, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))\n# If 'a' represents an apartment, then `ManagedBuilding(a)` and `AllowedPet(fluffy, a)` and `DepositAmount(a, d)` applied to an apartment would be a logical leap.\n# It is more likely that 'a' is intended to represent a building in which Tom rents an apartment.\n# However, the predicate `Rent(x, y)` means 'x' rents 'apartment y'.\n# Let's assume the problem intends that `Rent(tom, oliveGarden)` means Tom rents an apartment in OliveGarden.\n# In that case, the `\u2200a (Rent(tom, a) ...)` rule should be about buildings.\n# Let's rename the variable to 'b' for building.\n# \u2200b (TomRentsIn(tom, b) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))\n# And we need a predicate `TomRentsIn(x, y)`.\n\n# If we MUST stick to `Rent(x,y)` where y is an apartment, we need to introduce an apartment entity.\n# Let's assume the problem implicitly means that when we talk about renting in a managed building, we are talking about a specific apartment 'a' that is *within* that managed building.\n# Let's adjust the premise to reflect that 'a' is an apartment.\n\n# Reconsidering the original premises.\n# The original premise:\n# \u2200a (Rent(tom, a) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(a) \u2227 AllowedPet(fluffy, a) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(a, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))\n# This implies that 'a' must satisfy `ManagedBuilding(a)`. If 'a' is an apartment, then this is problematic.\n# However, if we interpret 'a' as the location (building) where Tom rents an apartment, and 'Rent(tom, a)' means \"Tom rents an apartment in location 'a'\", then the premise makes sense.\n# Let's rephrase the premise to be explicit about this interpretation.\n\n# Let's stick to the original predicates and try to make the most sensible interpretation.\n# It seems the variable 'a' in `Rent(tom, a)` is intended to represent a building where an apartment is rented.\n# And `ManagedBuilding(a)` and `AllowedPet(fluffy, a)` refer to building properties.\n# `DepositAmount(a, d)` also refers to the building.\n# So, 'a' is effectively treated as a building identifier here.\n# The predicate `Rent(x, y)` implies 'y' is an apartment. This is the core issue.\n\n# If 'a' is an apartment, then `ManagedBuilding(a)` is false.\n# If 'a' is a building, then `Rent(tom, a)` is problematic as 'a' is not an apartment.\n\n# Let's assume the problem implies that `Rent(tom, ApartmentIn(oliveGarden))` for example.\n# But we cannot introduce `ApartmentIn`.\n\n# Let's assume the simplest interpretation that makes the original premises work as written:\n# 'a' refers to a building, and `Rent(tom, a)` implies \"Tom rents an apartment in building 'a'\".\n\n# The premise `\u2200a (Rent(tom, a) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(a) \u2227 AllowedPet(fluffy, a) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(a, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))`\n# seems to treat 'a' as a building.\n# The predicate `Rent(x, y)` is defined as `x` rents `apartment y`.\n# This is a contradiction if 'a' is a building.\n\n# The most likely fix is to assume `Rent(x, y)` means \"x rents an apartment in location y\".\n# Given this interpretation, the original premises are largely correct.\n\n# Let's consider edge cases or simplifications.\n# The premise `\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, b))` simplifies `AllowedPet(fluffy, a)` in the renting condition if `ManagedBuilding(a)` is true.\n# So the rule becomes:\n# \u2200a (Rent(tom, a) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(a) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(a, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))\n# This simplification is valid and removes redundancy based on the given premises.\n\n# Let's rewrite the premises with this simplification.\n\n# Premises:\nFluffy(fluffy)\nTom(tom)\nCat(fluffy)\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 DepositRequired(b))\n\u2200b (DepositRequired(b) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(b) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(b)))\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, b))\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# Simplified premise for Tom's renting decision, removing redundant `AllowedPet` due to the premise above.\n# Assuming 'a' refers to a building where Tom rents an apartment.\n\u2200a (Rent(tom, a) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(a) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(a, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))\n# This revised premise directly captures \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if ... the security deposit is no more than $1500.\"\n# The condition \"he is allowed to move in with Fluffy\" is already implicitly covered because if the building is managed, Fluffy is allowed.\n# This simplification is sound.\n\n# Let's review the premises one last time for completeness and edge cases.\n# 1.

outer quantifier in P1), `Cond(a)` must be true.\n# So, if `Rent(tom, a)` is true, then `Cond(a)` is true.\n# P2 becomes: `Rent(tom, a) \u2192 (MoveIn(tom, a) \u2194 True)`.\n# This simplifies to: `Rent(tom, a) \u2192 MoveIn(tom, a)`.\n# The original P2 is a biconditional, implying `MoveIn(tom, a) \u2192 Rent(tom, a)` as well.\n# So, the original P2 states `Rent(tom, a) \u2194 Cond(a)`. This is exactly what P1 states for `a` being a managed building.\n\n# Therefore, P2 is entirely redundant given P1. The conditions for `Rent(tom, a)` being true are identical to the conditions for the right side of the biconditional in P2.\n\n# Let's remove P2.\n\n# Also, the predicate `Apartment(x)` is defined but never used.
