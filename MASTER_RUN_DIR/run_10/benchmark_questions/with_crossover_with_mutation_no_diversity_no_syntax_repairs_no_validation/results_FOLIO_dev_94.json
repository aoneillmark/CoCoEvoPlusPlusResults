Fluffy is allowed in `b`.\n# 3. The security deposit for `b` is no more than $1500.\n\n# Predicate clarification for DepositAmount:\n# DepositAmount(x, y) ::: The security deposit for building x is y.\n# So, `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` means the deposit for Olive Garden is $2000.\n\n# The condition \"security deposit is no more than $1500\" translates to:\n# `DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(d, 1500)` or `DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 LessThanOrEqualTo(d, 1500)`.\n# The original program used `LessThan(DepositAmount(y, 1500), 1500)`, which is syntactically incorrect. It likely intended to check if the deposit amount is less than 1500.\n\n# Let's express the deposit condition correctly:\n# If `DepositAmount(b, d)` holds, then `d <= 1500`.\n# This can be written as: `\u2200b, d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 \u00acMoreThan(d, 1500))`.\n# Or more directly if we know the deposit amount.\n\n# We know `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`.\n# We are also given `2000$ is more than $1500`.\n# Let's explicitly add this numerical relationship if not implicitly handled by `MoreThan` and `LessThan`.\n# The premise `\u2200x \u2200y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2192 (y >= 2000 \u2192 MoreThan(y, 1500)))` is problematic.\n# It should be `\u2200x, y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2192 MoreThan(y, 1500))` if the deposit is 2000.\n# Or `MoreThan(2000, 1500)`.\n\n# Let's assume `MoreThan` and `LessThan` work on numbers directly.\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\n\n# Now, let's refine the rent condition for Tom.\n# Tom rents an apartment in building `b` if `b` is managed, Fluffy is allowed in `b`, and deposit <= 1500.\n# Let's assume `Rent(x, y)` means \"person x rents apartment in building y\".\n# We don't have a specific predicate for \"AllowedPet(fluffy, building)\".\n# Instead, we can model the *condition* for Fluffy being allowed as part of the rent decision.\n# However, the prompt states \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy\".\n# This suggests `AllowedPet(fluffy, building)` is a prerequisite.\n# Let's re-introduce `AllowedPet` for clarity, and assume it's true for buildings Tom would consider.\n\n# For now, let's assume `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)` is implied if Tom is to consider it, or that the rent condition covers it.\n# The original premise `\u2200x AllowedPet(fluffy, x)` is too strong. Let's remove it and rely on the rent condition to imply it.\n\n# A more robust way to express the deposit condition:\n# If a deposit is required for building `b` and its amount is `d`, then `d` is either equal to one month's rent or more than one month's rent.\n# And if the rent is `r`, and deposit is `d`, then `d = r` or `d > r`.\n# In Olive Garden: Rent is 2000. Deposit is 2000.\n# This means `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`.\n# And `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`.\n# This implies `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)`.\n# However, the premise `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` contradicts this.\n# This is a bug in the premises.
