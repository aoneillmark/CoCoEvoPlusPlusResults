However, for typical football scenarios, loaning implies playing for the loaned club.\n# Assuming that loaning to a club implies playing for that club, the `LoanedTo` predicate implicitly covers the `PlaysFor` relationship in this context.\n# Thus, if `LoanedTo(x, y)` is true, then `PlaysFor(x, y)` should also be true.\n# To maintain consistency and avoid redundancy, we can assert `PlaysFor` based on `LoanedTo` or remove the explicit `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` if it's implied by `LoanedTo`.\n# For this revision, we'll keep both for clarity, but acknowledge the potential redundancy.\n# No other implicit relationships are immediately obvious or required by the given scenario.\n# The scenario states Ailton is loaned out to Braga, which implies he plays for Braga.\n# The scenario also states Ailton Silva plays for Nautico, which is another club.\n# This implies AiltonSilva can play for multiple clubs, or the \"PlaysFor\" predicate might refer to his primary club or registered club, and \"LoanedTo\" refers to a temporary assignment.\n# Given the explicit statements, we will retain all explicit premises.\n\n# Simplifications/Bug Fixes:\n# - The original premises were mostly correct and did not contain obvious bugs based on the scenario.\n# - The scenario implies AiltonSilva is a football player, which is captured by FootballPlayer(ailton_silva).\n# - The scenario states Ailton is loaned out to Braga, which is captured by LoanedTo(ailton_silva, braga).\n# - The scenario states Ailton Silva is a Brazillian footballer, captured by Brazilian(ailton_silva) and FootballPlayer(ailton_silva).\n# - The scenario states Ailton Silva plays for Nautico, captured by PlaysFor(ailton_silva, nautico).\n# - The scenario states Nautico is a football club along with Braga, captured by FootballClub(nautico) and FootballClub(braga).\n# - Fluminense is a football club, captured by FootballClub(fluminense).\n# - Ailton Silva born in 1995, captured by BornIn(ailton_silva, 1995).\n# - Ailton is commonly known as Ailton, captured by KnownAs(ailton_silva, ailton).\n\n# The original set of premises accurately reflects the provided scenario information without apparent bugs or missing edge cases based solely on the text.\n# Therefore, the revised program will maintain the original premises, assuming they were deliberately stated as such.\n# If a more complex interpretation was intended (e.g., a player can only play for one club at a time), then the original premises would need adjustment.\n# However, based on the provided text, the original premises are the most direct representation.\n\n# Reaffirming the original premises as they appear correct and complete for the given information.\nBornIn(AiltonSilva, 1995).\nKnownAs(AiltonSilva, Ailton).\nFootballPlayer(AiltonSilva).\nBrazilian(AiltonSilva).\nPlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico).\nPlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga).\nLoanedTo(AiltonSilva, Braga).\nFootballClub(Nautico).\nFootballClub(Braga).\nFootballClub(Fluminense).\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2203x (LoanedTo(AiltonSilva, x) \u2227 FootballClub(x))\n",
