Let's make the connection explicit:\n# If `Person(x)` and `glu` is a condition that can occur, then `FeelingTired(x)`.\n# To use the original premise structure, we need to assert the existence of

The original premises already cover this.\n# The premise \"Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)\" seems to be a general statement about glus,\n# not directly related to Monkeypox symptoms unless a glu itself is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The scenario states \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" and \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\".\n# This implies that if a person gets a glu (which could be a symptom of Monkeypox), they feel tired.\n# The problem is the undefined nature of \"glu\". If \"glu\" is intended to be a specific symptom or condition\n# associated with Monkeypox, this should be clearer.\n# Assuming \"glu\" is an independent condition that also causes tiredness, as stated.\n# The current premises capture this.\n# Let's refine the understanding of \"People feel tired when they get a glu\".\n# This means if someone is a person and they acquire/experience a 'glu', they experience 'feeling tired'.\n# We have FeelingTired(x) as a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is a bit ambiguous.\n# A more direct interpretation might be:\n# If `x` is a Person and `g` is a Glu, then `x` experiences `FeelingTired`.\n# But we have the predicate `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)`.\n# Let's keep the original interpretation of the premise as it's the most direct use of the given predicates.\n# The existence of `FeelingTired(x)` as a symptom implies that `x` IS feeling tired.\n# The `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` predicate implies a relationship.\n# The most straightforward way to connect `FeelingTired` as a symptom with the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate\n# is to assume that if Monkeypox causes tiredness, and a person has Monkeypox, then that person will feel tired.\n# And if a person gets a glu, they also feel tired.\n# The original premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is fine for its stated purpose.\n# The potential confusion is if 'glu' is meant to be a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The prompt asks to fix bugs, add missing edge cases, or simplify logic.\n# The logic seems to be:\n# 1. Monkeypox -> InfectiousDisease\n# 2. Monkeypox -> CausedBy(MonkeypoxVirus)\n# 3. MonkeypoxVirus -> OccurIn(Human) OR OccurIn(Animal)\n# 4. Human -> Mammal -> Animal\n# 5. Symptoms of Monkeypox: Fever, Headache, MusclePains, FeelingTired\n# 6. People feel tired when they get a glu. (This is an independent fact about 'glu' and people).\n# 7. Human -> Person.\n# The phrasing \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is a separate statement about tiredness and 'glu'.\n# The connection to Monkeypox is that FeelingTired is a symptom.\n# If a human has Monkeypox, they might feel tired.\n# If a human gets a glu, they will feel tired.\n# This means a human can feel tired through multiple causes: Monkeypox symptoms or glus.\n# The original premises are logically sound for what they state.\n# There isn't an obvious \"bug\" or \"missing edge-case\" directly related to the logic presented,\n# unless \"glu\" is intended to be a specific symptom of Monkeypox, which is not explicitly stated.\n# If we were to simplify or add edge cases, it would require making assumptions about 'glu'.\n# For instance, if 'glu' were a symptom of Monkeypox, we'd add:\n# Glu(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(x, Monkeypox).\n# And then, if Monkeypox occurs in humans:\n# Human(x) \u2227 SymptomOf(s, Monkeypox) \u2192 FeelingTired(x) if s is FeelingTired.\n# But \"glu\" is presented as a separate cause of tiredness for people.\n# The existing premises are already quite general and cover the statements.\n\n# Let's reconsider the premise: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# And \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\".\n# This can be interpreted that FeelingTired is a symptom.\n# And a separate statement is about glus causing tiredness.\n# The premises are:\n# SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)\n# Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)\n# Human(x) \u2192 Person(x)\n# The predicate FeelTiredWhen(x, g) is not directly linked to FeelingTired(x).\n# A person feels tired *when* they get a glu. This implies that feeling tired is the state.\n# Perhaps the predicate `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` is intended to mean that `x` will feel tired if `y` occurs.\n# So, `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelingTired(x)` would be a clearer representation if we were allowed to introduce `FeelingTired(x)` as a state.\n# However, we must use the given predicates.\n# The original premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` establishes a relationship.\n# If we assume that `FeelingTired` is a state that `x` is in, and `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is a predicate indicating that state is caused by `g`.\n# Then we can rewrite it slightly to emphasize that the *event* of getting a glu causes the state.\n# But the current predicate is already a relation.\n\n# Let's assume the original premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is the most accurate representation using the given predicates.\n# There are no obvious bugs, missing edge cases, or simplifications needed without making assumptions not present in the problem description.\n# The problem asks for a *different* program that satisfies the *same* problem.\n# This implies we can rephrase or re-structure the logic while keeping the meaning identical.\n\n# Let's re-examine the relationship between `FeelingTired` as a symptom and `FeelTiredWhen`.\n# If `FeelingTired` is a symptom, it means that `FeelingTired` is a characteristic of someone with Monkeypox.\n# If `Human(x)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`, then `FeelingTired(x)`.\n# The premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is about a separate cause of tiredness.\n\n# Perhaps the intention is to ensure that if something is a symptom of Monkeypox, and Monkeypox occurs in humans, then humans can experience that symptom.\n# And if a human gets a glu, they feel tired.\n\n# Let's create a new program by slightly altering the presentation and using implications where possible.\n\n# Revised approach:\n# Focus on making the relationships explicit.\n# The core of the problem is understanding the symptoms and causes of tiredness.\n\n# Symptoms of Monkeypox:\n# Fever, Headache, MusclePains, FeelingTired are all symptoms of Monkeypox.\n# If x is a symptom of Monkeypox, then x is either Fever or Headache or MusclePains or FeelingTired.\n# This could be represented as:\n# For all s, SymptomOf(s, Monkeypox) \u2192 (s = Fever \u2228 s = Headache \u2228 s = MusclePains \u2228 s = FeelingTired).\n# However, we are not given equality or disjunctions for predicates. We must use the given predicates.\n# The current premises are direct assertions.\n\n# Let's try to make the causation of tiredness more explicit for Monkeypox.\n# If Monkeypox occurs in a human, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, then that human feels tired.\n# The original premises state SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox).\n# And OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human).\n# And Human(x) \u2192 Animal(x).\n# And Human(x) \u2192 Person(x).\n# So, if Monkeypox is caused by MonkeypoxVirus, and MonkeypoxVirus occurs in humans, then Monkeypox occurs in humans.\n# Let's introduce a predicate `HasDisease(person, disease)` for clarity. (Not allowed, must stick to existing predicates.)\n\n# The most straightforward interpretation is to keep the existing premises and perhaps reorder or slightly rephrase them.\n# The task asks for a *different* program.\n# The original program uses direct assertions and implications.\n# We can achieve a \"different\" program by restructuring or using alternative forms of expression if possible within the constraints.\n\n# Consider the relationship `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human)`.\n# And `CausedBy(Monkeypox, MonkeypoxVirus)`.\n# This implies `Monkeypox` occurs in humans.\n# Let's use a predicate `Affects(disease, organism)` if we were allowed.\n\n# Let's try to make the connection between symptoms and individuals explicit.\n\n# --- NEW PROGRAM ---\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (Human(x) \u2227 Glu(x))\n",

The original premises already cover this.\n# The premise \"Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)\" seems to be a general statement about glus,\n# not directly related to Monkeypox symptoms unless a glu itself is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The scenario states \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" and \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\".\n# This implies that if a person gets a glu (which could be a symptom of Monkeypox), they feel tired.\n# The problem is the undefined nature of \"glu\". If \"glu\" is intended to be a specific symptom or condition\n# associated with Monkeypox, this should be clearer.\n# Assuming \"glu\" is an independent condition that also causes tiredness, as stated.\n# The current premises capture this.\n# Let's refine the understanding of \"People feel tired when they get a glu\".\n# This means if someone is a person and they acquire/experience a 'glu', they experience 'feeling tired'.\n# We have FeelingTired(x) as a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is a bit ambiguous.\n# A more direct interpretation might be:\n# If `x` is a Person and `g` is a Glu, then `x` experiences `FeelingTired`.\n# But we have the predicate `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)`.\n# Let's keep the original interpretation of the premise as it's the most direct use of the given predicates.\n# The existence of `FeelingTired(x)` as a symptom implies that `x` IS feeling tired.\n# The `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` predicate implies a relationship.\n# The most straightforward way to connect `FeelingTired` as a symptom with the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate\n# is to assume that if Monkeypox causes tiredness, and a person has Monkeypox, then that person will feel tired.\n# And if a person gets a glu, they also feel tired.\n# The original premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is fine for its stated purpose.\n# The potential confusion is if 'glu' is meant to be a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The prompt asks to fix bugs, add missing edge cases, or simplify logic.\n# The logic seems to be:\n# 1. Monkeypox -> InfectiousDisease\n# 2. Monkeypox -> CausedBy(MonkeypoxVirus)\n# 3. MonkeypoxVirus -> OccurIn(Human) OR OccurIn(Animal)\n# 4. Human -> Mammal -> Animal\n# 5. Symptoms of Monkeypox: Fever, Headache, MusclePains, FeelingTired\n# 6. People feel tired when they get a glu. (This is an independent fact about 'glu' and people).\n# 7. Human -> Person.\n# The phrasing \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is a separate statement about tiredness and 'glu'.\n# The connection to Monkeypox is that FeelingTired is a symptom.\n# If a human has Monkeypox, they might feel tired.\n# If a human gets a glu, they will feel tired.\n# This means a human can feel tired through multiple causes: Monkeypox symptoms or glus.\n# The original premises are logically sound for what they state.\n# There isn't an obvious \"bug\" or \"missing edge-case\" directly related to the logic presented,\n# unless \"glu\" is intended to be a specific symptom of Monkeypox, which is not explicitly stated.\n# If we were to simplify or add edge cases, it would require making assumptions about 'glu'.\n# For instance, if 'glu' were a symptom of Monkeypox, we'd add:\n# Glu(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(x, Monkeypox).\n# And then, if Monkeypox occurs in humans:\n# Human(x) \u2227 SymptomOf(s, Monkeypox) \u2192 FeelingTired(x) if s is FeelingTired.\n# But \"glu\" is presented as a separate cause of tiredness for people.\n# The existing premises are already quite general and cover the statements.\n\n# Let's reconsider the premise: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# And \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\".\n# This can be interpreted that FeelingTired is a symptom.\n# And a separate statement is about glus causing tiredness.\n# The premises are:\n# SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)\n# Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)\n# Human(x) \u2192 Person(x)\n# The predicate FeelTiredWhen(x, g) is not directly linked to FeelingTired(x).\n# A person feels tired *when* they get a glu. This implies that feeling tired is the state.\n# Perhaps the predicate `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` is intended to mean that `x` will feel tired if `y` occurs.\n# So, `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelingTired(x)` would be a clearer representation if we were allowed to introduce `FeelingTired(x)` as a state.\n# However, we must use the given predicates.\n# The original premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` establishes a relationship.\n# If we assume that `FeelingTired` is a state that `x` is in, and `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is a predicate indicating that state is caused by `g`.\n# Then we can rewrite it slightly to emphasize that the *event* of getting a glu causes the state.\n# But the current predicate is already a relation.\n\n# Let's assume the original premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is the most accurate representation using the given predicates.\n# There are no obvious bugs, missing edge cases, or simplifications needed without making assumptions not present in the problem description.\n# The problem asks for a *different* program that satisfies the *same* problem.\n# This implies we can rephrase or re-structure the logic while keeping the meaning identical.\n\n# Let's re-examine the relationship between `FeelingTired` as a symptom and `FeelTiredWhen`.\n# If `FeelingTired` is a symptom, it means that `FeelingTired` is a characteristic of someone with Monkeypox.\n# If `Human(x)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`, then `FeelingTired(x)`.\n# The premise `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` is about a separate cause of tiredness.\n\n# Perhaps the intention is to ensure that if something is a symptom of Monkeypox, and Monkeypox occurs in humans, then humans can experience that symptom.\n# And if a human gets a glu, they feel tired.\n\n# Let's create a new program by slightly altering the presentation and using implications where possible.\n\n# Revised approach:\n# Focus on making the relationships explicit.\n# The core of the problem is understanding the symptoms and causes of tiredness.\n\n# Symptoms of Monkeypox:\n# Fever, Headache, MusclePains, FeelingTired are all symptoms of Monkeypox.\n# If x is a symptom of Monkeypox, then x is either Fever or Headache or MusclePains or FeelingTired.\n# This could be represented as:\n# For all s, SymptomOf(s, Monkeypox) \u2192 (s = Fever \u2228 s = Headache \u2228 s = MusclePains \u2228 s = FeelingTired).\n# However, we are not given equality or disjunctions for predicates. We must use the given predicates.\n# The current premises are direct assertions.\n\n# Let's try to make the causation of tiredness more explicit for Monkeypox.\n# If Monkeypox occurs in a human, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, then that human feels tired.\n# The original premises state SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox).\n# And OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human).\n# And Human(x) \u2192 Animal(x).\n# And Human(x) \u2192 Person(x).\n# So, if Monkeypox is caused by MonkeypoxVirus, and MonkeypoxVirus occurs in humans, then Monkeypox occurs in humans.\n# Let's introduce a predicate `HasDisease(person, disease)` for clarity. (Not allowed, must stick to existing predicates.)\n\n# The most straightforward interpretation is to keep the existing premises and perhaps reorder or slightly rephrase them.\n# The task asks for a *different* program.\n# The original program uses direct assertions and implications.\n# We can achieve a \"different\" program by restructuring or using alternative forms of expression if possible within the constraints.\n\n# Consider the relationship `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human)`.\n# And `CausedBy(Monkeypox, MonkeypoxVirus)`.\n# This implies `Monkeypox` occurs in humans.\n# Let's use a predicate `Affects(disease, organism)` if we were allowed.\n\n# Let's try to make the connection between symptoms and individuals explicit.\n\n# --- NEW PROGRAM ---\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",

implication rules.\n# However, the task is to modify the *current program*, which uses specific instances.\n\n# Let's add a premise to connect the symptom to the actual feeling for a person with the disease.\n# This is the most likely missing piece.\n# Premise: If a person `p` is a human and has monkeypox `mp`, and `tiredness` is a symptom of `mp`, then `p` feels tired.\n# This would involve a predicate like `HasDisease(person, disease)`.\n\n# Let's stick to the original predicates and try to infer the feeling tired state.\n# Original:\n# `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`\n# `FeelingTired(tiredness)`\n# `Person(x) -> Human(x)`\n# `Glu(glu)`\n# `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(glu) -> FeelTiredWhen(x, glu)`\n\n# A potential bug: the `FeelingTired(tiredness)` predicate might be too general.\n# It implies `tiredness` is a state of feeling tired.\n# We need to connect this symptom of monkeypox to a *person* feeling tired due to monkeypox.\n\n# Let's try to simplify the symptom predicates by using a single predicate for symptoms.\n# This would be a significant departure from the current structure.\n\n# Back to the potential gap: feeling tired due to Monkeypox.\n# We have `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`.\n# We have `FeelingTired(tiredness)`.\n# We have `Person(x)`.\n# We need to assert that a person with monkeypox *feels* tired.\n\n# Let's assume `FeelingTired(x)` refers to the state of feeling tired.\n# The current premises don't establish that a person *having* monkeypox experiences the symptom of tiredness.\n# They only state that tiredness *is* a symptom.\n\n# Let's try this approach to fix the gap:\n# If `Human(p)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(s, mp)` and `s` is a type of feeling tired,\n# then `p` feels tired.\n# This still feels like it needs more predicates or a stronger rule.\n\n# A simpler approach: If `Human(h)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`,\n# then the *state* of `tiredness` is experienced by `h`.\n# This is still hard to express with the current predicates.\n\n# Let's re-examine the prompt: \"fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\"\n\n# Simplification:\n# `Monkeypox(mp)` and `CausedBy(mp, mpv)` implies that `mpv` causes `mp`.\n# `OccurIn(mpv, h)` implies that `mpv` can occur in `h`.\n# From these, we can infer that `mp` can occur in `h`.\n# Adding a premise for this general rule:\n# `OccurIn(virus, host) \u2227 CausedBy(disease, virus) -> CanOccurIn(disease, host)`\n# This might be considered adding new logic rather than fixing/simplifying.\n\n# Let's focus on the feeling tired aspect.\n# The current premises do not explicitly state that a human with monkeypox feels tired.\n# We have `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)` and `FeelingTired(tiredness)`.\n# The missing link is that if a *human* has monkeypox, they *experience* the symptom of tiredness.\n\n# Let's add a premise that states this connection.\n# We need a predicate like `HasDisease(person, disease)`.\n# But we are supposed to use existing predicates.\n\n# Let's try to infer the feeling tired state more directly.\n# If `Human(x)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(s, mp)` and `FeelingTired(s)`:\n# This implies that the symptom `s` is a state of feeling tired.\n# We need to assert that `x` *experiences* this state.\n\n# Let's simplify the symptoms by asserting a general rule about symptoms:\n# If

implication rules.\n# However, the task is to modify the *current program*, which uses specific instances.\n\n# Let's add a premise to connect the symptom to the actual feeling for a person with the disease.\n# This is the most likely missing piece.\n# Premise: If a person `p` is a human and has monkeypox `mp`, and `tiredness` is a symptom of `mp`, then `p` feels tired.\n# This would involve a

predicates by using a single predicate for symptoms.\n# This would be a significant departure from the current structure.\n\n# Back to the potential gap: feeling tired due to Monkeypox.\n# We have `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`.\n# We have `FeelingTired(tiredness)`.\n# We have `Person(x)`.\n# We need to assert that a person with monkeypox *feels* tired.\n\n# Let's assume `FeelingTired(x)` refers to the state of feeling tired.\n# The current premises don't establish that a person *having* monkeypox experiences the symptom of tiredness.\n# They only state that tiredness *is* a symptom.\n\n# Let's try this approach to fix the gap:\n# If `Human(p)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(s, mp)` and `s` is a type of feeling tired,\n# then `p` feels tired.\n# This still feels like it needs more predicates or a stronger rule.\n\n# A simpler approach: If `Human(h)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`,\n# then the *state* of `tiredness` is experienced by `h`.\n# This is still hard to express with the current predicates.\n\n# Let's re-examine the prompt: \"fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\"\n\n# Simplification:\n# `Monkeypox(mp)` and `CausedBy(mp, mpv)` implies that `mpv` causes `mp`.\n# `OccurIn(mpv, h)` implies that `mpv` can occur in `h`.\n# From these, we can infer that `mp` can occur in `h`.\n# Adding a premise for this general rule:\n# `OccurIn(virus, host) \u2227 CausedBy(disease, virus) -> CanOccurIn(disease, host)`\n# This might be considered adding new logic rather than fixing/simplifying.\n\n# Let's focus on the feeling tired aspect.\n# The current premises do not explicitly state that a human with monkeypox feels tired.\n# We have `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)` and `FeelingTired(tiredness)`.\n# The missing link is that if a *human* has monkeypox, they *experience* the symptom of tiredness.\n\n# Let's add a premise that states this connection.\n# We need a predicate like `HasDisease(person, disease)`.\n# But we are supposed to use existing predicates.\n\n# Let's try to infer the feeling tired state more directly.\n# If `Human(x)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(s, mp)` and `FeelingTired(s)`:\n# This implies that the symptom `s` is a state of feeling tired.\n# We need to assert that `x` *experiences* this state.\n\n# Let's simplify the symptoms by asserting a general rule about symptoms:\n# If `SymptomOf(s, disease)` and `disease` can occur in a `person`, then `person` can experience symptom `s`.\n# This is complex.\n\n# Let's try a simpler fix for the feeling tired part.\n# The current premises don't create an instance of someone feeling tired due to monkeypox.\n# They create a condition for feeling tired (getting a glu).\n\n# Let's add a premise to bridge this:\n# If a human `h` has monkeypox `mp`, and `tiredness` is a symptom of `mp`, then `h` feels tired.\n# This requires relating `Human(h)` to `Monkeypox(mp)`.\n# We know `OccurIn(mpv, h)` and `CausedBy(mp, mpv)`. This means `mp` *can* occur in `h`.\n\n# Let's assume that if a disease can occur in a human, and a state is a symptom of that disease, then the human experiences that state.\n# `Human(h) \u2227 CausedBy(disease, virus) \u2227 OccurIn(virus, h) \u2227 SymptomOf(s, disease) \u2227 FeelingTired(s) -> FeelTired(h)`\n# This is adding a significant new rule.\n\n# Let's simplify the structure of symptoms.\n# Instead of listing each symptom as a separate premise, we can group them.\n# However, the current format is fine and adheres to the original.\n\n# The most critical missing piece is the direct causation of feeling tired from monkeypox in humans, beyond the \"glu\" condition.\n# Let's assume `FeelingTired(x)` implies `x` is a state of being tired.\n# And `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)` implies this state is a symptom.\n\n# Revised premise to fix the feeling tired gap:\n# If a person `p` is human, and monkeypox `mp` can occur in `p`, and `tiredness` is a symptom of `mp`,\n# then `p` feels tired.\n# To express \"monkeypox can occur in `p`\":\n# We know `CausedBy(mp, mpv)` and `OccurIn(mpv, p)`.\n# So, if `Human(p)` and `CausedBy(mp, mpv)` and `OccurIn(mpv, p)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)` and `FeelingTired(tiredness)`, then `p` feels tired.\n# This is getting complex.\n\n# Let's simplify by assuming the context implies a direct link.\n# If `Human(h)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`, then `h` feels tired.\n# This requires a way to assert `Human(h)` has `Monkeypox(mp)`.\n\n# Let's try a minimal change that addresses the feeling tired symptom:\n# Add a premise connecting the symptom to the state for humans.\n# If `Human(x)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`, then `x` can experience `tiredness`.\n# This requires `x` to have `mp`.\n\n# Consider the existing premises:\n# `Human(h)`\n# `Monkeypox(mp)`\n# `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`\n# `FeelingTired(tiredness)`\n\n# Let's add an explicit link for the feeling tired symptom for humans:\n# If `Human(x)` and `Monkeypox(mp)` and `SymptomOf(s, mp)` and `FeelingTired(s)`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This is a general rule that is missing.\n\n# Simpler fix: If `Human(h)` and `Monkeypox(mp)`, and `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`, then `h` experiences tiredness.\n# We can infer `Human(h)` has monkeypox because `OccurIn(mpv, h)` and `CausedBy(mp, mpv)`.\n# Let's make a premise that directly asserts the human feeling tired due to monkeypox.\n\n# New premise to fix the gap:\n# If a human `h` is infected with Monkeypox `mp`, and `tiredness` is a symptom of `mp`, then `h` feels tired.\n# This still requires a `infected with` predicate.\n\n# Let's try to keep it within the existing predicate structure as much as possible.\n# Let's assume the intent of `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)` and `FeelingTired(tiredness)` implies a direct link when a human has monkeypox.\n\n# Simplification: Remove explicit mention of `h` and `a` as specific instances, and use generic `x` if possible.\n# However, `mp` and `mpv` are specific.\n\n# Let's focus on making the \"feeling tired\" aspect clear and not solely dependent on \"glu\".\n# The original program has:\n# `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)`\n# `FeelingTired(tiredness)`\n# `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(glu) -> FeelTiredWhen(x, glu)`\n\n# Missing: The connection between Monkeypox and feeling tired directly.\n# Let's add a premise: If a human `x` has monkeypox `mp`, and `tiredness` is a symptom of `mp`, then `x` feels tired.\n# How to state \"human `x` has monkeypox `mp`\" using existing predicates?\n# `Human(x) \u2227 CausedBy(mp, mpv) \u2227 OccurIn(mpv, x)` implies `x` can have `mp`.\n\n# Let's try to simplify by consolidating symptom definitions if possible, but the task is to fix/add/simplify *existing logic*.\n# The most apparent issue is the lack of a direct premise stating that the symptom of tiredness from Monkeypox causes a human to feel tired, independent of the 'glu' condition.\n\n# Let's add a premise that directly links the symptom to the feeling for a human.\n# If `Human(x)` and `SymptomOf(tiredness, mp)` and `FeelingTired(tiredness)`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This assumes that if `tiredness` is a symptom of `mp`, and `x` is human, then `x` experiences `tiredness`.\n# This is a reasonable inference from the context.\n\n# Final set of premises, focusing on fixing the feeling tired gap and minimal changes.\n# I will add a premise that directly states a human feeling tired due to monkeypox if tiredness is a symptom.\n# This addresses the missing link.\n\n# Simplified predicates (not required by prompt, but for thought):\n# Monkeypox(d)\n# InfectiousDisease(d)\n# CausedBy(d, v)\n# MonkeypoxVirus(v)\n# OccurIn(v, host)\n# Animal(host)\n# Human(host)\n# Mammal(host)\n# Symptom(s, d) #
