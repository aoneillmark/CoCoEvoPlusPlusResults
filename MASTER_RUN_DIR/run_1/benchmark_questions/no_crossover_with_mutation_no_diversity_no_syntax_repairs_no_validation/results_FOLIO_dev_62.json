The original premise `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` was intended to apply specifically to Mike. However, the quantifier `\u2200x` makes it apply to all international students in the US who want to work, which is not explicitly stated in the problem. By removing the `\u2200x` quantifier and making it specific to Mike, we fix this bug.\n2. The predicates `CPT()` and `OPT()` are constants representing CPT and OPT respectively. This is already correctly represented.\n3. The original premises correctly capture the conditions for international students in the US.\n4. No additional edge cases or missing logic were identified beyond the scope of the specific rules provided.\n\n# Revised Premises:\nInternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) ::: Mike is an international student in US.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))) ::: International students in US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))) ::: An international student in US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.\nInternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) ::: Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
