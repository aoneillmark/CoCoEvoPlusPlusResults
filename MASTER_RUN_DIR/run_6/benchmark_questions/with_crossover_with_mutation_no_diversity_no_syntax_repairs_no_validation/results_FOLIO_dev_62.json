Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n# This rule is specific to Mike and his desire to work.\n# Given Mike is a person, has an F1 visa (from premises), and wants to work, this implies he needs to apply for CPT.\n# Encoding this as a general rule that applies to any person with these characteristics is consistent.\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# This rule is precise because it links the need for CPT to having an F1 visa and wanting to work.\n# It is more specific than rule 2, implying CPT is the required application in this context.\n# The previous rule `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` was too general, as it did not consider the visa type and could incorrectly apply to a J1 student.\n# The current rule `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` correctly uses F1Visa and Person, which is appropriate for Mike.\n\n# Simplified and correct logic:\n# Premises:\nPerson(mike)\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nWork(mike)\nF1Visa(mike)\n\n# Axioms:\n# 1. International students in the US have either an F1 or J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n\n# 2.

Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n# Given Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, this rule implies that CPT is a necessary application for him.\n# This can be expressed as a specific instance of a broader rule:\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# This rule is more precise than the original third rule because it explicitly requires F1Visa, aligning with the scenario's focus on visa types for work authorization.\n# The previous general rule for Mike `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` was too broad as it did not enforce F1Visa, which is a critical condition for CPT/OPT.\n# This revised rule uses `Person(x)` and `F1Visa(x)` which correctly frames the condition for Mike.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",

Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\"\n# This implies that the condition \"wants to work\" is met for Mike, but it was not explicitly stated as a premise.\n# I've added `MikeNeedsToWork(mike)` as a premise to make this explicit and ensure that the rules about CPT/OPT can be applied to Mike.\n# The existing rules are fine, but they need the condition \"Work(x)\" to be true for the conclusions to be drawn.\n# The predicate \"Work(x)\" is general, so it's better to introduce a specific premise for Mike if we want to infer something about him wanting to work.\n# If the intention was for Mike to *always* need to apply for CPT *regardless* of whether he wants to work, that would be a different rule:\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Person(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# However, the current wording \"if he wants to work\" suggests the work condition is necessary.\n# Therefore, adding `MikeNeedsToWork(mike)` makes the existing rules applicable to Mike's situation.\n# The rule `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` already covers Mike if `Work(mike)` is true.\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is directly encoded in the third premise if we assume Work(mike) is true.\n\n# Note: The premise \"\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\" makes the separate statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" redundant if we assert Work(mike).\n# However, if Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he might *also* need to apply for OPT. The rules are not mutually exclusive.\n# The scenario implies that the \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is a *specific* instance of the more general rule, or perhaps a simplified rule for Mike.\n# Given the prompt, it's best to stick to the general rules and ensure the conditions for Mike are met.\n# The inclusion of `MikeNeedsToWork(mike)` is the most direct way to enable inferences about Mike wanting to work, which then allows the existing rules to apply to him.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
