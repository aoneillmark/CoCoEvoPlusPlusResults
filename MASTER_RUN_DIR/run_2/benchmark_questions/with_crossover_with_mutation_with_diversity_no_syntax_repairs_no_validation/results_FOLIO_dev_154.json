This is always true due to the equivalence.\n# A more accurate interpretation of the last sentence implies a specific state for Remy related to these conditions.\n# Let's re-evaluate the last sentence: \"Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\"\n# This can be interpreted as:\n# ( (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) ) \u2228 ( \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) )\n# Given the established equivalence: \u2200x ((GoesToBedLate(x) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(x)) \u2194 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x))\n# The statement for Remy simplifies to:\n# ( SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) \u2227 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) ) \u2228 ( \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) \u2227 \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) )\n# Which is:\n# SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) \u2228 \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy)\n# This is a tautology and doesn't add new information.\n# Let's consider the implication of the \"OR\" clause. The original statement implies that Remy falls into one of two *specific* scenarios, not just that one of the two disjuncts is true.\n# It seems the intention is to assert that Remy *either* fits the \"tidying leads to sleeping late\" rule *or* the \"not tidying leads to not sleeping late\" rule.\n# The most direct translation of the last sentence, and assuming the previous equivalence holds, points to:\n# Remy either has the conditions that lead to tidying and *actually* tidies, or Remy *doesn't* have those conditions and *doesn't* tidy.\n# This means the conditions that trigger tidying (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) are consistent with SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy).\n# The original statement: ( (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) ) \u2228 ( \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) )\n# is equivalent to:\n# ((P \u2227 Q) \u2227 R) \u2228 (\u00ac(P \u2227 Q) \u2227 \u00acR) where P = GoesToBedLate(remy), Q = WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy), R = SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy)\n# And we have (P \u2227 Q) \u2194 R.\n# If (P \u2227 Q) is true, then R must be true. This makes the first disjunct (T \u2227 T) \u2228 (F \u2227 F) = T.\n# If (P \u2227 Q) is false, then R must be false.

The original program doesn't make this deduction because it includes Premise 6, which causes a contradiction.\n# The fix is to remove Premise 6, as it creates an unsolvable logical system when combined with Premise 5.\n# The last sentence for Remy, combined with Premise 5, *replaces* the need for Premise 6 for Remy, and also implies Remy's state.\n\n# Let's rewrite the premises.\n\n# The original problem has a contradiction. Premise 5 states:\n# \u2200x (SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x) \u2192 \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(x) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(x)))\n# And Premise 6 states:\n# \u2200x ((GoesToBedLate(x) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(x)) \u2194 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x))\n# From Premise 6, we can derive:\n# \u2200x (SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x) \u2192 (GoesToBedLate(x) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(x)))\n# This directly contradicts Premise 5, unless the antecedent is always false.\n\n# To fix this, we must remove one of the conflicting premises or modify them.\n# The last sentence about Remy provides a specific structure for Remy.\n# Let's use that structure along with Premise 5 to infer Remy's state, and remove the problematic universal Premise 6.\n\n# Simplified logic:\n# Chain: HasFullyStockedAndImpressiveHomeOffice(x) \u2192 OwnsLargeDesktopMonitor(x) \u2192 WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(x)\n# Also: WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(x) \u2192 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x)\n# And: WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(x) \u2192 VisitsOfficeSupplyStoreRegularly(x)\n\n# Key rule 1 (from scenario): SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x) \u2192 \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(x) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(x))\n\n# Key rule 2 (Remy's specific condition):\n# ( (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) ) \u2228 ( \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) )\n\n# Let's combine these for Remy.\n# Let A = (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy))\n# Let B = SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy)\n# Key rule 1 for Remy: B \u2192 \u00acA\n# Key rule 2 for Remy: (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB)\n\n# If B is true:\n# From Key rule 1: \u00acA must be true.\n# From Key rule 2: (A \u2227 True) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 False) = A \u2228 False = A.\n# So, from Key rule 2, A must be true.\n# This leads to \u00acA and A being true simultaneously, which is a contradiction.\n# Therefore, B must be false. SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) is false.\n\n# If B is false:\n# From Key rule 1: B \u2192 \u00acA becomes False \u2192 \u00acA, which is always true. This doesn't constrain A.\n# From Key rule 2: (A \u2227 False) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 True) = False \u2228 \u00acA = \u00acA.\n# So, from Key rule 2, \u00acA must be true.\n# This means A is false: \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)).\n\n# So the conclusion is:\n# SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) is false.\n# \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) is true.\n\n# This means we can remove Premise 6 entirely, as it was the source of the contradiction and its role is superseded by the specific logic for Remy combined with Premise 5.\n# The last sentence for Remy, when combined with Premise 5, actually tells us something specific about Remy.\n\n# Let's rephrase the premises:\n# 1. Chain of implications about home office and work:\n# \u2200x (HasFullyStockedAndImpressiveHomeOffice(x) \u2192 OwnsLargeDesktopMonitor(x))\n# \u2200x (OwnsLargeDesktopMonitor(x) \u2192 WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(x))\n# \u2200x (WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(x) \u2192 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x))\n# \u2200x (WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(x) \u2192 VisitsOfficeSupplyStoreRegularly(x))\n\n# 2. General rule about tidying and sleep:\n# \u2200x (SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(x) \u2192 \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(x) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(x)))\n\n# 3. Remy's specific condition, which when combined with rule 2, constrains Remy's state:\n# The original phrasing:\n# ( (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) ) \u2228 ( \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) )\n# This statement is equivalent to:\n# (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2194 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy)\n# But this is what caused the contradiction with premise 5 if applied universally.\n# The phrasing of the last sentence is \"Remy either X or Y\". This is an inclusive OR unless specified, but in natural language it often implies exclusive OR. If it's exclusive OR:\n# ( (GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 SpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) ) XOR ( \u00ac(GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2227 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy)) \u2227 \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(rem\n\n# Conclusion:\n( ( GoesToBedLate(remy) \u2228 WakesUpEveryDayAfterNoon(remy) ) \u2228 VisitsOfficeSupplyStoreRegularly(remy) ) \u2192 ( \u00acSpendsFreeTimeTidyingAndOrganizing(remy) \u2227 \u00acHasFullyStockedAndImpressiveHomeOffice(remy) )\n",
