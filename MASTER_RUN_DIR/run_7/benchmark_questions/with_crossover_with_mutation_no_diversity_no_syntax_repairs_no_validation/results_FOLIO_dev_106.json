implies we should directly infer his hardship from his family situation.\n\n# Let's assume the existing predicates and premises are sufficient and we just need to make the connections.\n# The key is to show Tom *proves* EconomicHardship to get FinancialAid.\n# The current setup implies:\n# GREApplicant(Tom)\n# We need to derive Prove(Tom, EconomicHardship).\n\n# The scenario gives:\n#

This *causes* HavingTooLittleMoney and HavingTooFewResources for Tom.\n# So we can say:\n# CausedBy(EconomicHardship, HavingTooLittleMoney)  <- This is general.\n# CausedBy(EconomicHardship, HavingTooFewResources) <- This is general.\n\n# The specific context for Tom is:\n# Dad(DadOfTom, Tom)\n# OutOfWork(DadOfTom, MoreThanOneYear)\n\n# This situation for DadOfTom implies:\n# CausedBy(TomHardshipInstance, HavingTooLittleMoney)\n# CausedBy(TomHardshipInstance, HavingTooFewResources)\n# And this TomHardshipInstance refers to Difficulty.\n# And therefore, TomHardshipInstance is EconomicHardship.\n\n# Let's make a direct link that Tom faces economic hardship.\n# We can add a premise that states Tom is indeed experiencing economic hardship.\n# Prove(Tom, EconomicHardship) is the key to getting FinancialAid.\n# The scenario implies Tom *can* prove it.\n\n# Let's add a direct premise for Tom experiencing EconomicHardship.\n# IsEconomicHardshipFor(x, y) ::: x is economic hardship for y.\n# IsEconomicHardshipFor(EconomicHardship, Tom)\n\n# However, the prompt asks to fix bugs, add edge cases, or simplify logic.\n# The original program has `EconomicHardship(EconomicHardship)`. This implies `EconomicHardship` is a specific instance.\n# The definition `\u2200x (EconomicHardship(x) \u2194 ...)` means `EconomicHardship` itself is a predicate.\n# So, `EconomicHardship(EconomicHardship)` is likely a mistake in the original program,\n# where `EconomicHardship` is used both as a predicate and a constant.\n\n# Let's assume `EconomicHardship` is a predicate. The constants are `GRE`, `205USD`, `ETS`, `FinancialAid`, `Tom`, `SingleParentFamily`, `MoreThanOneYear`, `Difficulty`, `HavingTooLittleMoney`, `HavingTooFewResources`.\n\n# Let's fix the use of EconomicHardship.\n# Original: `EconomicHardship(EconomicHardship)`\n# Corrected: `EconomicHardship(HardshipInstance)` where `HardshipInstance` is a new constant.\n# Or, infer Tom has economic hardship without a specific constant for it initially.\n\n# Revised approach based on fixing `EconomicHardship(EconomicHardship)`:\n# The predicate `EconomicHardship(x)` means `x` is economic hardship.\n# The scenario describes a situation that *constitutes* economic hardship for Tom.\n# So, instead of `EconomicHardship(EconomicHardship)`, we should infer that Tom is in a state of economic hardship.\n\n# The core of the problem is to show that Tom qualifies for financial aid.\n# This requires `GREApplicant(Tom)` and `Prove(Tom, EconomicHardship)`.\n# We have `GREApplicant(Tom)`.
