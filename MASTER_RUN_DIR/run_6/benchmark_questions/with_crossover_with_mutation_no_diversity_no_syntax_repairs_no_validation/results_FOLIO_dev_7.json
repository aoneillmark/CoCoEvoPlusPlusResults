This is an independent fact about glus.\n# 2. This fact explains *why* feeling tired is a symptom of monkeypox (i.e., monkeypox leads to glus, which lead to fatigue).\n# The original logic doesn't establish a link between `mp` and `g` or `glu` and `mp`.\n# The most straightforward interpretation is that feeling tired is a symptom of MP, and also,\n# people feel tired when they get glus. These are separate facts about fatigue.\n\n# Let's consider \"edge cases\" or missing information.\n# - What if there are other animals monkeypox can occur in? `OccurIn(mpv, a)` covers this generally.\n# - What if there are other symptoms? Not specified in the context.\n# - What if a person is not a mammal? This is excluded by `Human(h) \u2192 Mammal(h)`.\n# - The problem states \"Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans.\"\n#   Our premises `OccurIn(mpv, a)` and `OccurIn(mpv, h)` capture this.\n\n# Simplification opportunity:\n# The premises `Animal(a)`, `Human(h)`, `Mammal(m)`, `Person(p)`, `Glu(g)` being declared as specific instances might be more useful if used in general rules.\n# However, the problem statement and the existing program seem to be operating at the level of specific named instances.\n\n# Re-evaluating the `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` and `SymptomOf(feelingTired, mp)` interaction.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is quite specific.\n# If the intent was that monkeypox *causes* glus, which then cause tiredness, that link is missing.\n# The current setup implies that feeling tired can be a symptom of MP, and separately, glus can cause tiredness.\n# This seems correct based on the literal reading.\n\n# Let's ensure the hierarchy of Human, Mammal, Animal is explicitly represented if not already.\n# Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x)\n# Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x)\n# This implies Human(x) \u2192 Animal(x)\n\n# The current premises are:\n# Human(h) \u2192 Mammal(h)\n# Mammal(m) \u2192 Animal(m)\n# This establishes the hierarchy for any given `h` and `m`.\n# If `h` is a specific human, then `Human(h)` is true, so `Mammal(h)` is true.\n# If `m` is a specific mammal, then `Mammal(m)` is true, so `Animal(m)` is true.\n# We have `Human(h)` declared as a premise. This means `h` is a human, and thus `Mammal(h)` is true.\n# If `h` is a human, then `h` is a mammal.\n# If `m` is a mammal, then `m` is an animal.\n\n# Let's assume the goal is to make the logic more robust or cover implicit relationships.\n# The sentence \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" implies a causal link for that specific situation.\n# The sentence \"Symptons of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on.\"\n# implies that `feeling tired` is a direct consequence or indicator of Monkeypox.\n\n# Let's make the symptom link more direct for persons.\n# If `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`, and `p` is a person with `Monkeypox`, then `p` can feel tired *due to Monkeypox*.\n# The premise `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` states `p` feels tired when they get `g`.\n# This is a specific instance.\n\n# Let's try to unify the expression of fatigue.\n# If `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`, then `Monkeypox` can cause `FeelingTired`.\n# If `p` is a person and `p` has `Monkeypox`, then `p` experiences `FeelingTired`.\n# This can be expressed:\n# `Monkeypox(mp) \u2227 Person(p) \u2192 feels_tired(p, mp)` (using a hypothetical `feels_tired` predicate)\n# Or by relating it to the existing `FeelingTired` predicate:\n# `Monkeypox(mp) \u2227 Person(p) \u2192 FeelingTired(p)` (if `FeelingTired` could take a person as argument)\n# But `FeelingTired(x)` is defined as `x is feeling tired`.

These are separate facts about fatigue.\n\n# Let's consider \"edge cases\" or missing information.\n# - What if there are other animals monkeypox can occur in? `OccurIn(mpv, a)` covers this generally.\n# - What if there are other symptoms?
