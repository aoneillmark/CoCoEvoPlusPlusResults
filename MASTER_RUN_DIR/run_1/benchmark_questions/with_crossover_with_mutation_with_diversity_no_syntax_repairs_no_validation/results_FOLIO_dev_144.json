General definitions like `BreedingBack(bb)` are moved to rules or existential premises if they represent universal truths about the domain.\n# 3. **Improved Rules**:\n#    - Introduced `BreedingBackProcess(x)` to represent the action or process of breeding back, making the rule `BreedingBackProcess(x) -> ArtificialSelection(x)` more precise than a rule directly from `BreedingBack(x)`.\n#    - The rule `Extinct(x) -> Animal(x)` is a reasonable assumption in this context: if an animal type is extinct, it was an animal.\n#    - The rule `SelectiveBreeding(x) -> Exists y (DomesticAnimals(y))` correctly captures the implicit existence of domestic animals in selective breeding.\n#    - The rule `ToBreedBack(x) -> Animal(x)` remains.\n# 4. **Added Existential Premises/Rules**:\n#    - The statement \"Breeding back is a form of artificial selection\" is now a rule `BreedingBackProcess(x) -> ArtificialSelection(x)`, where the existence of `BreedingBackProcess` is inferred from facts like `BredBack(hc, 1920s)`.\n#    - The statement \"Some animals to be bred back resemble animals that are extinct\" is added as an explicit existential premise: `Exists x (ToBreedBack(x) AND Exists y (Animal(y) AND Extinct(y) AND Resemble(x, y)))`. This directly encodes this crucial aspect of the scenario.\n# 5. **Removed Redundant Premises**: Premises like `BreedingBack(bb)`, `ArtificialSelection(bb)`, `SelectiveBreeding(sb)`, `DomesticAnimals(da)` from the original were placeholders for general concepts. These are now handled more robustly by rules and existential premises. The premise `Exists x (Animal(x) \u2227 ToBreedBack(x))` is implicitly covered by the existential premise about animals to be bred back.\n\n# Final structure of the output:\n# --- BEGIN OUTPUT ---\n# Premises:\n# ...\n# Rules:\n# ...\n# --- END OUTPUT ---\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
