`DepositAmount(x, 1500)` is a predicate that is true if the deposit for `x` is exactly $1500$.\n# And `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` is a predicate that is true if the deposit for `x` is strictly less than $1500$.\n# This interpretation is consistent with the structure `LessThan(Term, Value)`.\n\n# So, the condition \"no more than $1500\" means `DepositAmount(x, 1500) \u2228

attempt to use `\u2203y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(y, 1500))` is a more logically sound representation of \"no more than $1500\" if `DepositAmount(x, y)` means \"y is the deposit for x\".\n# However, the original premise structure hints at a different interpretation of `DepositAmount(x, 1500)`.\n# Sticking to fixing the logical operator from `<` to `<=`.\n\n# Let's assume `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` is a predicate that is true if the deposit for `x` is exactly $1500$.\n# And `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` is a predicate that is true if the deposit for `x` is strictly less than $1500$.\n# This interpretation is consistent with the structure `LessThan(Term, Value)`.\n\n# So, the condition \"no more than $1500\" means `DepositAmount(x, 1500) \u2228 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)`.\n# This is the most direct logical fix to the \"no more than\" condition while keeping the predicate structure.\n\n#
