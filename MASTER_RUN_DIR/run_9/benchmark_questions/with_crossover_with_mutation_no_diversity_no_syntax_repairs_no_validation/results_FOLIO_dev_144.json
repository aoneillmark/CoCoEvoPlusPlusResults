So `x` is an animal.\n# So `HeckCattle(x) \u2192 ToBreedBack(x)` is correct if `x` refers to an individual Heck cattle.\n# If `heckCattle` in `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` refers to the type or a group, then the inference should be more general.\n# But given the structure, `HeckCattle(x) \u2192 ToBreedBack(x)` is the most direct way to use the existing predicates.\n\n# Consider the case where `year1920s` is not a constant but a variable.\n# The current premise `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` uses a specific instance. This is fine.\n\n# Final Check:\n# - Fixed bugs: No obvious bugs found, mostly clarifications.\n# - Added missing edge-cases: The link between `BredBack` fact and `ToBreedBack` predicate is made explicit.\n# - Simplified logic: Using the equivalence for `BreedingBack` is cleaner.\n\n# Final program based on the understanding above:\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
