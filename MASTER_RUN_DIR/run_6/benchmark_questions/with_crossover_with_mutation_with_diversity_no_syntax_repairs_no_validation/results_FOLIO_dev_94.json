The most direct interpretation is deposit = rent, as no other value is given.\n\n# Therefore, LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500) is False.\n\n# Now let's consider the 'AllowedPet' part for Tom.\n# The problem states \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\"\n# This implies that if these conditions are not met, he won't rent.\n# The core logic is about Tom renting.\n\n# We are given:\n# 1. OliveGarden is a ManagedBuilding.\n# 2. RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# 3. DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) (inferred/stated).\n# 4. MoreThan(2000, 1500). This means LessThan(2000, 1500) is false.\n\n# From the premise: \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, z), 1500)))).\n# For x = oliveGarden:\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500)).\n# Since LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500) is false, the right side of the biconditional is false.\n# Therefore, Rent(tom, oliveGarden) must be false.\n\n# This new program directly models the conditions and facts given.\n# It simplifies some of the predicate definitions and combines them into clearer rules where possible.\n# For example, the explicit definition of DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is added as a key fact for reasoning about Olive Garden.\n# The logic for Tom renting is kept as a biconditional, which is the most precise representation of \"if and only if\".\n# The rules about DepositEqualToOneMonthRent and DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent are kept to show the possibilities, but for Olive Garden, the fact DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) makes the LessThan(DepositAmount, 1500) condition false.\n# No specific rule is needed for AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) as the deposit condition is already failing.\n\n# Note: The original program had a potentially problematic premise:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x))\n# This was an assumption that *all* managed buildings allow Fluffy. The current problem description does not state this.\n# Tom's renting condition is dependent on *both* being allowed *and* the deposit. If the deposit fails, it doesn't matter if Fluffy is allowed. The current program correctly omits this broad assumption.\n\n# The premise \u2200x \u2200y (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 Rent(tom, x) \u2192 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, z), 1500)))\n# and \u2200x \u2200y (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, z), 1500) \u2192 Rent(tom, x))\n# were redundant as they are fully captured by the biconditional version:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, z), 1500))))\n# This is used in the new program.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",

The current encoding's interpretation of the rule:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (PetsAreAllowedInSomeManagedBuildings(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, deposit_amount), 1500)))).\n# implies that PetsAreAllowedInSomeManagedBuildings(fluffy, x) is a prerequisite for Rent(tom, x).\n# Let's make this more explicit for the specific case of Olive Garden if Tom is to rent.\n# We infer AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, oliveGarden) if and only if Tom rents in oliveGarden.\n\n# Since RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), and MoreThan(2000, 1500) is true,\n# the condition LessThanOrEqual(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500) is false.\n# This means Rent(tom, oliveGarden) is false, which implies AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, oliveGarden) must be false\n# if we strictly follow the biconditional.\n# This is a potential edge case or interpretation issue. The phrasing \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings\"\n# suggests there are buildings where pets ARE allowed.\n# The core issue is that the prompt doesn't state *if* Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden,\n# only the conditions for Tom renting *if* Fluffy is allowed.\n# Let's assume the problem implies Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden if the conditions for Tom renting were met.\n# However, based on the given numeric values, they are NOT met.\n# The original program's statement \"\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (PetsAreAllowedInSomeManagedBuildings(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, deposit_amount), 1500)))).\"\n# And then asserting DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and MoreThan(2000, 1500) leads to a contradiction or\n# Tom not renting and Fluffy not being allowed in Olive Garden *by definition of the rule*.\n# To fix this, we assume the problem implies a possibility, not a certainty, that Fluffy might be allowed.\n# The most direct interpretation of the scenario description: \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\"\n# This is a conditional rule. The specific situation at Olive Garden makes the second part of the condition false.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the implication of \"AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, x)\"\n# The prompt does not explicitly state if Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden.\n# The rule for Tom renting *depends* on this allowance.\n# Given the current facts, Tom cannot rent in Olive Garden because the deposit is too high.\n# This implies that either Fluffy is not allowed, OR the deposit condition failed.\n# The biconditional implies:\n# Rent(tom, x) -> AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, x)\n# Rent(tom, x) -> LessThanOrEqual(DepositAmount(x, deposit_amount), 1500)\n# AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, x) AND LessThanOrEqual(DepositAmount(x, deposit_amount), 1500) -> Rent(tom, x)\n\n# Based on the given facts for Olive Garden:\n# ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden) is true.\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is true.\n# MoreThan(2000, 1500) is true.\n# Therefore, LessThanOrEqual(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500) is false.\n# From the rule: (AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, oliveGarden) AND False) -> Rent(tom, oliveGarden)\n# This simplifies to False -> Rent(tom, oliveGarden), which is always true and gives no info about Rent(tom, oliveGarden).\n\n# The other direction: Rent(tom, oliveGarden) -> (AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, oliveGarden) AND LessThanOrEqual(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500))\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) -> (AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, oliveGarden) AND False)\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) -> False\n# This means Rent(tom, oliveGarden) must be false.\n\n# This is consistent with the problem statement: Tom won't rent if the deposit is too high.\n# The program is correct in inferring Tom won't rent.\n# The variable `PetsAreAllowedInSomeManagedBuildings` was used as a predicate, which is unusual.\n# Renamed it to `AllowedPetInBuilding`.\n\n# If the intention was to say Fluffy *is* allowed in Olive Garden, then the premise would need to be:\n# AllowedPetInBuilding(fluffy, oliveGarden).\n# But the problem doesn't state this directly. The current setup correctly infers Tom doesn't rent.\n\n# Add a premise for the deposit rule to be more explicit:\n# The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\n\u2200x, r, d (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 RentAmount(x, r) \u2227 DepositAmount(x, d) \u2192 (d = r \u2228 d > r)).\n# This can be further represented using the defined predicates:\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 \u2200r, d (RentAmount(x, r) \u2227 DepositAmount(x, d) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2227 RentAmount(x,r) implies DepositAmount(x,r) or DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x) and RentAmount(x,r) implies DepositAmount(x,d) where d > r))).\n# A simpler way to state this using the predicates:\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 \u2200r, d (RentAmount(x, r) \u2227 DepositAmount(x, d) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)))).\n# This is already present.
