General rule: InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT)\n# 2. Specific rule for Mike: x = mike \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT)\n\n# If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, rule 1 implies he needs CPT OR OPT.\n# Rule 2 implies Mike needs CPT if he wants to work.\n# Combining these, Mike needs CPT, and he might also need OPT. The specific rule for Mike (rule 2) is a stronger assertion that CPT is definitely needed.\n# The original prompt's wording of rule 2 is: \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" This is already covered by the premises and the general rule.\n# Let's assume the intent is to ensure CPT is always a possibility *for Mike* when working, and perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the specific rule for Mike overrides or adds to the general rule.\n# However, a common simplification in logic is to remove redundancy. The general rule about F1 visa holders covers Mike.\n\n# To simplify and avoid potential redundancy or misinterpretation, we can rely on the general rule for F1 visa holders and the specific premise that Mike has an F1 visa.\n# The premise \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is actually a consequence of the general rule and the fact that Mike is an international student in the US with an F1 visa and wants to work.\n# If we want to preserve this specific statement about Mike, we can rephrase it to be an explicit fact derived from other rules, or if it's meant to be an additional constraint, we keep it.\n# Given the prompt asks to simplify logic, and the specific rule for Mike is a direct consequence of the general rule and his situation, we can remove the redundant specific rule about Mike if it doesn't add new information.\n\n# However, if the intent of the third rule is to imply that CPT is a *necessary* application *for Mike* when working, and the general rule only states CPT *or* OPT, then there's a subtlety.\n# Let's assume the specific rule for Mike is intended to be an additional, perhaps stronger, requirement.\n# To make the logic clearer and potentially address an edge case where Mike *must* apply for CPT, even if OPT is also an option or if the general rule seems more permissive:\n\n# Option 1: Assume the specific rule for Mike is redundant as explained above. In this case, the following program would be simpler.\n# (See the original program as it is already quite good in this interpretation)\n\n# Option 2: If the intent is to highlight that Mike has a direct requirement for CPT *regardless* of the general rule or any other condition except 'wants to work', and this is a special case:\n# The current premise \"F1Visa(mike)\" is given.\n# The general rule states: \u2200 x. (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT))\n# The specific rule states: \u2200 x. (x = mike \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT))\n# With the premises, we can deduce:\n# From premises and general rule: NeedsToApply(mike, CPT) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT)\n# From premises and specific rule: NeedsToApply(mike, CPT)\n\n# The specific rule for Mike seems to assert that CPT is a definite requirement for him when working.\n# The prompt says \"Make edits that fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\"\n# The current logic is not buggy, but the third rule for Mike is a direct consequence of the general rule and Mike's specific situation. Removing it simplifies the logic.\n# Let's assume the simplification means removing redundant rules.\n\n# REVISED PROGRAM (Simplified by removing redundant specific rule for Mike):\n# The rules provided are:\n# 1. International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n# 2. An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if they want to work in the US.\n# 3. Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n\n# Given: Mike is an international student, in the US, wants to work, and has an F1 visa.\n\n# From rule 2 and Mike's situation, we can infer: NeedsToApply(mike, CPT) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT).\n# Rule 3 directly states: NeedsToApply(mike, CPT).\n# This implies that CPT is a definite requirement for Mike. This doesn't contradict rule 2, it just makes one of the options (CPT) certain for Mike.\n\n# To simplify, we can observe that the third rule is essentially a specific instance of the second rule when applied to Mike, but it *asserts* CPT specifically.\n# If we want to adhere to the prompt's directive to *simplify logic* and *fix bugs/edge-cases*, and considering that the third rule is directly derivable from the second rule and the premises about Mike, it is redundant.\n# The prompt also asks to keep the same vocabulary and format.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate if there's any missing edge case.\n# An edge case could be if Mike *didn't* have an F1 visa, but the premises state he does.\n# Another edge case could be if the \"or\" in the second rule was inclusive/exclusive. It's typically inclusive in logic.\n# The prompt specifically asks to write a *new program that is different from this program*. This implies we should make some changes, not just copy it.\n\n# How to make it different and potentially better, or simpler?\n# One way to simplify is to make the rules more general or combine them if possible, but here the specificity for Mike is key.\n# Perhaps the \"bug fix\" refers to how the rules are stated.\n\n# Let's consider the implications again.\n# Rule 2: If A and B and C and D, then E or F.\n# Rule 3: If G and D, then E. (where G is x=mike)\n\n# Given: A, B, C, D, G are true for Mike.\n# From Rule 2: E or F is true for Mike.\n# From Rule 3: E is true for Mike.\n\n# This is consistent. E is true, and E or F is also true.\n\n# To make the program *different* and *simpler*, we can try to rephrase the rules or use implications differently.\n# The current third rule is: \u2200 x. (x = mike \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT))\n# This is equivalent to: (mike = mike \u2227 Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT)) which simplifies to: (Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT)) given mike=mike.\n\n# Since we have Work(mike) as a premise, this directly implies NeedsToApply(mike, CPT).\n# So the premise Work(mike) and the rule \u2200 x. (x = mike \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT)) are very closely linked.\n# The entire rule \u2200 x. (x = mike \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT)) can be simplified to just the assertion: NeedsToApply(mike, CPT), given that Work(mike) is a premise and 'mike' is a constant.\n\n# Let's try a different approach. Combine the predicates for Mike.\n\n# --- NEW PROGRAM ---\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",

All international students in the US must have either an F1 or J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))\n\n# 2. Any international student in the US who wants to work must apply for CPT.\n# This rule directly reflects the specific statement about Mike, generalized.\n# It implies that Work(x) for an international student in the US is a sufficient condition for NeedsToApply(x, CPT()).\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# 3. (Optional, if OPT is also an option for F1 students)\n# If an international student in the US has an F1 visa and wants to work, they can also apply for OPT.\n# This would add the option for OPT, but the phrasing \"Mike needs to apply for CPT\" implies CPT is a primary requirement.\n# If we want to include OPT as a possibility for F1 students, we would need:\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n# However, the task is to simplify or fix bugs. The original program had a rule allowing both CPT and OPT for F1 students.\n# The statement about Mike seems to prioritize CPT.\n\n# Final Decision: Keep the rule that directly addresses the \"Mike needs CPT if he works\" statement,\n# generalized to all international students in the US. This makes the logic simpler and more direct for the stated fact.\n# The premise F1Visa(mike) will be used to infer that Mike *could* potentially use OPT if that were the only consideration.\n# But the specific rule for Mike overrides or specifies this.\n\n# Simplified and Corrected Program:\n# Premises:\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nPerson(mike)\nF1Visa(mike) # Kept as it's a factual premise about Mike.\nWork(mike)\n\n# Axioms:\n# All international students in the US must have either an F1 or J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))\n\n# Any international student in the US who wants to work must apply for CPT.\n# This axiom directly reflects the statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\"\n# and is generalized.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# This simplified program correctly captures the stated conditions.\n# The fact that Mike has an F1 visa and the general rule for F1 students allowing OPT\n# becomes secondary to the specific requirement that Mike *needs* CPT if he works.\n# This removes the potential ambiguity of needing CPT OR OPT if only CPT is explicitly stated as a need.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
