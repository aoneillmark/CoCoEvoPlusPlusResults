All foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. If people grew up as only children with no siblings, then they tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. If people have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, then they grew up as only children with no siblings. All households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs.
