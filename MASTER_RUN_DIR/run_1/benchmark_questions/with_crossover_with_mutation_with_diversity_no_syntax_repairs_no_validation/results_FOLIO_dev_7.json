Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus.\nCausedBy(monkeypox, monkeypoxVirus)\n# 3. monkeypoxVirus is the monkeypox virus.\nMonkeypoxVirus(monkeypoxVirus)\n# 4. Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.\nOccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, animal)\n# 5. Monkeypox virus can occur in humans.\nOccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, human)\n# 6. Humans are mammals.\nHuman(x) -> Mammal(x)\n# 7. Mammals are animals.\nMammal(x) -> Animal(x)\n# 8. Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and feeling tired.\n# The original used \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) -> SymptomOf(Condition, x)).\n# This implies 'Monkeypox' is a predicate. However, the first premise was `Monkeypox(monkeypox)`.\n# This suggests `monkeypox` is an instance, and `Monkeypox(x)` is a predicate.\n# If `Monkeypox(x)` is a predicate, then `SymptomOf(Fever, x)` means `Fever` is a symptom of `x`.\n# And `x` is an instance of `Monkeypox`.\n# This is a bit inconsistent with `Monkeypox(monkeypox)`.\n# Let's assume `Monkeypox` is a specific disease instance `monkeypox`.\n# So, `monkeypox` has these symptoms.\nSymptomOf(fever, monkeypox)\nSymptomOf(headache, monkeypox)\nSymptomOf(musclePains, monkeypox)\nSymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)\n\n# 9. People feel tired when they get a glu.\n# As discussed, the original `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 SymptomOf(Glu, x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, SymptomOf(Glu, x)))` is problematic.\n# Assuming 'glu' is a constant condition.\n# And 'Person' is equivalent to 'Human'.\nPerson(x) -> Human(x)\n# This premise should state that for any person, if they \"get a glu\", they feel tired.\n# `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` means 'x feels tired when y occurs/is present'.\n# So, if x is a person and y is `glu`, then `FeelTiredWhen(x, glu)` holds.\nPerson(x) -> FeelTiredWhen(x, glu)\n\n# I need to ensure I'm not duplicating the \"CURRENT PROGRAM\" but creating a \"new program\".\n# The new program should be a set of premises.\n# The vocabulary is kept.\n# The logic is simplified or fixed.\n# Edge cases are addressed.\n\n# Missing edge cases or simplifications:\n# - The original implied `Monkeypox(x)` as a predicate but used `Monkeypox(monkeypox)` as a fact.\n#   This new program will treat `monkeypox` as a constant representing the disease itself.\n# - The `OccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, animals)` and `OccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, humans)` implies the virus can be in them.\n#   It doesn't explicitly state Monkeypox disease occurs in humans, but it's implied by virus occurrence.\n#   I will add `OccurIn(monkeypox, human)` for clarity.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",

This is an instance property.\n# For generality, if Monkeypox is a type of disease, we can say:\n# Forall d. Monkeypox(d) -> InfectiousDisease(d)\n# But the problem uses `Monkeypox(mp)`, so `mp` is an instance. Let's stick to that.\n\n# The virus MonkeypoxVirus is a virus (implicitly, from naming convention).\n# This isn't strictly necessary with the current predicates, but good for clarity if we had a Virus predicate.\n\n# Connection between the virus and the disease: Monkeypox is caused by the MonkeypoxVirus.\n# `CausedBy(mp, mp_virus)` handles this for the instance `mp`.\n\n# Connecting the disease to the symptoms:\n# If x is Monkeypox, then Fever is a symptom of x.\n# This was added above to be more explicit about what *are* symptoms.\n# The original rule `Monkeypox(x) & SymptomOf(y, x) -> (Fever(y) | Headache(y) | MusclePains(y) | FeelingTired(y))`\n# is a constraint on what symptoms *can be*.\n# To make it so that these *are* symptoms, we need to assert `SymptomOf`.\n# Let's add these explicit assertions if the intent is \"these are symptoms\".\n# Forall x.

Monkeypox(x) -> SymptomOf(Fever, x) (and for Headache, MusclePains, FeelingTired)\n# This makes Fever a predicate that can be a symptom.\n\n# The original program uses `Fever(x)` to mean `x is a fever`.\n# If `Fever` is a specific instance of a symptom (like 'the fever associated with MP'),\n# then the original rule is okay, but it's confusing.\n# Let's assume Fever, Headache etc. are predicates that *identify* a symptom.\n# So, if `Fever(some_event)`, then `some_event` is a fever.\n# The rule `Monkeypox(x) & SymptomOf(y, x) -> (Fever(y) | Headache(y) | MusclePains(y) | FeelingTired(y))`\n# means: For any disease x, if x is Monkeypox, and y is a symptom of x, then y is a fever OR a headache OR muscle pains OR feeling tired.\n# This structure implies y is an *instance* of a symptom type.\n# This is good. Let's ensure the definitions of those predicates match.\n# `Fever(x) ::: x is a fever.` This means Fever is a property of an *event* or *state*.\n# `SymptomOf(x, y) ::: x is a symptom of y.` Here x is a symptom, y is the disease.\n# So the original rule means: For any disease `x` and any symptom `y`, if `x` is Monkeypox and `y` is a symptom of `x`, then `y` is a fever, or `y` is a headache, etc.\n\n# The original code's intent seems to be:\n# 1.

Same for Human.\n# - `Human(h) -> Mammal(h)` -> Added `forall h.`\n# - `Mammal(m) -> Animal(m)` -> Added `forall m.`\n# - Symptom rules: The original rule `Monkeypox(x) & SymptomOf(y, x) -> (Fever(y) | Headache(y) | MusclePains(y) | FeelingTired(y))` is kept.\n#   However, the premise \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and feeling tired\" needs to be more explicitly stated by asserting that these *are* symptoms.\n#   The original program did NOT explicitly state `SymptomOf(Fever, mp)`.\n#   My proposed `forall x. Monkeypox(x) -> SymptomOf(Fever, x)` makes Fever a predicate representing a symptom type that is associated with Monkeypox.\n#   This seems more aligned with the intent.\n\n# Let's consider an alternative for symptoms to be more precise on \"include\".\n# If `Fever`, `Headache`, etc., are *types* of symptoms:\n# `Fever` is a type of symptom.\n# `SymptomOf(FeverType, Disease)` could be a predicate.\n# But the original defines `Fever(x) ::: x is a fever`. This means `Fever` applies to an *instance* of a symptom.\n# So, `SymptomOf(y, x)` means `y` is a symptom of `x`.\n# And `Fever(y)` means `y` is a fever.\n# The original program lacks premises like `SymptomOf(Fever, mp)` or `Fever(some_symptom_instance)`.\n# It only has the *rule* about what symptoms *can be*.\n# To fix this: we need to assert that `Fever` (as a symptom type) is indeed a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The current predicates are:\n# Fever(x) ::: x is a fever.\n# SymptomOf(x, y) ::: x is a symptom of y.\n# The rule `Monkeypox(x) & SymptomOf(y, x) -> (Fever(y) | Headache(y) | MusclePains(y) | FeelingTired(y))`\n# states that if `y` is a symptom of `x` (where `x` is Monkeypox), then `y` must be of type Fever, Headache, etc.\n# This means the predicates Fever, Headache etc. identify the *type* of symptom.\n# So, to say \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever\", we should assert that `Fever` itself is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The predicates are a bit ambiguous here. If `Fever` is a specific instance, then `SymptomOf(Fever, mp)` makes sense.\n# If `Fever` is a type, then `SymptomOf(FeverType, mp)` is better.\n# Given `Fever(x) ::: x is a fever`, `Fever` is a predicate applied to an instance.\n# So, `SymptomOf(Fever, mp)` means \"Fever is a symptom of mp\".

If `Fever` is a specific instance, then `SymptomOf(Fever, mp)` makes sense.\n# If `Fever` is a type, then `SymptomOf(FeverType, mp)` is better.\n# Given `Fever(x) ::: x is a fever`, `Fever` is a predicate applied to an instance.\n# So, `SymptomOf(Fever, mp)` means \"Fever is a symptom of mp\".
