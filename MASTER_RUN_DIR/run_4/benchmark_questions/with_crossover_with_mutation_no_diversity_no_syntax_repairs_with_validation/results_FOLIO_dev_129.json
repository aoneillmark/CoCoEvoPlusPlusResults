has a wedding in July OR John travels to Paris.\"\n\n# So the rule for John becomes:\n# If John has a well-attended wedding, then (John has a wedding in July OR John travels to Paris).\n\n# Let's use `HasWedding(p)` for person `p` has a wedding, and `WellAttended(w)` for wedding `w`.\n# And `OccursInJuly(w)` for wedding `w`.\n# `BelongsTo(w, p)` links wedding `w` to person `p`.\n\n# Revised rule:\n# For John: if there exists a wedding `w` such that `BelongsTo(w, john)` and `WellAttended(w)`\n# then `\u2203w' (BelongsTo(w', john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w'))` OR `TravelsToParis(john)`.\n# This is still complex.\n\n# Let's try to simplify the logic using the existing predicates and avoid introducing new ones.\n# The original rule for John:\n# HasChild(john) \u2192 \u00acTravelsToParis(john) \u2227 \u00acHasWedding(john)\n\n# Let's revisit the original predicates and the problematic rule.\n# \"If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n\n# Consider the structure `if X then (Y or (not Y and Z))` which simplifies to `if X then (Y or Z)`.\n# X: John has a well-attended wedding.\n# Y: John has a wedding in July.\n# Z: John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\n# The challenge is how to express \"John has a well-attended wedding\" and \"John has a wedding in July\" using the existing predicates.\n# Let's assume `HasWedding(p)` means person `p` has *a* wedding.\n# Let `WellAttended(w)` be a property of wedding `w`.\n# Let `OccursInJuly(w)` be a property of wedding `w`.\n# Let `BelongsTo(w, p)` link wedding `w` to person `p`.\n\n# Rule 1: \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p) \u2192 HasChild(p))\n# Rule 2: \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 TravelsToParis(p) \u2192 HasWedding(p))\n# Rule 3: \u2200w (Wedding(w) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w) \u2192 \u2203p (Person(p) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 TravelsToParis(p)))\n# Rule 4: \u2203w (Wedding(w) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w) \u2227 WellAttended(w))\n# Rule 5: HasChild(john) \u2192 \u00acTravelsToParis(john) \u2227 \u00acHasWedding(john)\n# Rule 6: Original was: \u2200p \u2200w ((Person(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p, w) \u2227 WellAttended(w)) \u2192 (OccursInJuly(w) \u2228 \u00acTravelsToParis(p)))\n# Let's assume the intent was for John, and we adapt to the available predicates.\n\n# For John, the condition \"John has a wedding that is well-attended\" implies there exists a wedding `w` such that `BelongsTo(w, john)` AND `WellAttended(w)`.\n# The consequence is \"John has a wedding in July OR John travels to Paris\".\n# \"John has a wedding in July\" means `\u2203w' (BelongsTo(w', john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w'))`.\n\n# Simplified last rule:\n# If John has a well-attended wedding, then John has a wedding in July OR John travels to Paris.\n# This still requires quantifying over weddings for John.\n\n# Let's try to phrase it more directly for John without quantifiers if possible, or using existing predicates.\n# The original rule uses `WeddingInJuly(x)` which is a predicate for weddings.\n\n# Let's try to make the last rule explicit for John, given the predicates.\n# If there is a wedding `w` such that `BelongsTo(w, john)` AND `WellAttended(w)`,\n# THEN there is a wedding `w_j` such that `BelongsTo(w_j, john)` AND `OccursInJuly(w_j)`) OR `TravelsToParis(john)`.\n\n# To simplify:\n# Let `JohnsWedding(w)` be `BelongsTo(w, john)`.\n# Let `JohnsWeddingInJuly(w)` be `JohnsWedding(w) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w)`.\n# Let `JohnsWellAttendedWedding(w)` be `JohnsWedding(w) \u2227 WellAttended(w)`.\n\n# Rule 6 (simplified):\n# \u2200w (JohnsWellAttendedWedding(w) \u2192 (\u2203w' JohnsWeddingInJuly(w') \u2228 TravelsToParis(john)))\n# This is still complex.\n\n# Let's go back to the interpretation of the rule:\n# \"If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July OR John travels to Paris.\"\n# This is `\u2203w (BelongsTo(w, john) \u2227 WellAttended(w)) \u2192 (\u2203w' (BelongsTo(w', john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w')) \u2228 TravelsToParis(john))`\n\n# The original rule was:\n# \u2200p \u2200w ((Person(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p, w) \u2227 WellAttended(w)) \u2192 (OccursInJuly(w) \u2228 \u00acTravelsToParis(p)))\n# If we apply this to John, and use `HasWedding(p)` for existence and `BelongsTo(w, p)`:\n# For John, if `HasWedding(john)` and there exists `w` s.t. `BelongsTo(w, john)` and `WellAttended(w)`,\n# then `OccursInJuly(w)` OR `\u00acTravelsToParis(john)`.\n# This means if *any* of John's weddings are well-attended, *that specific wedding* must be in July or John doesn't travel to Paris.\n\n# Let's simplify the last rule and make it more consistent.\n# If John has a well-attended wedding `w`, then `w` is in July OR John travels to Paris.\n# This assumes `WellAttended` and `OccursInJuly` are properties of the same wedding `w` that John has.\n\n# Final attempt at simplification and correction:\n# The original predicates are a bit mixed. `HasWedding(x)` for person, `Wedding(x)` for event, `WellAttended(x)` for event.\n# `WeddingInJuly(x)` for wedding `x`. `OccursInJuly(y)` for wedding `y`.\n# This suggests `OccursInJuly` and `WeddingInJuly` are similar. Let's stick to `OccursInJuly`.\n\n# Rule 6 needs careful phrasing:\n# If John has a wedding `w` that is well-attended, then `w` occurs in July OR John travels to Paris.\n# Condition: `\u2203w (BelongsTo(w, john) \u2227 WellAttended(w))`\n# Consequence: `(\u2203w' (BelongsTo(w', john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w'))) \u2228 TravelsToParis(john)`\n\n# Revised Premises:\n\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p) \u2192 HasChild(p))\n\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 TravelsToParis(p) \u2192 HasWedding(p))\n\u2200w (Wedding(w) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w) \u2192 \u2203p (Person(p) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 TravelsToParis(p)))\n\u2203w (Wedding(w) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w) \u2227 WellAttended(w))\nHasChild(john) \u2192 \u00acTravelsToParis(john) \u2227 \u00acHasWedding(john)\n\n# Simplified last rule:\n# If John has a well-attended wedding `w`, then `w` occurs in July or John travels to Paris.\n# This means if John has *any* well-attended wedding `w`, then EITHER that specific wedding `w` is in July OR John travels to Paris.\n# This is still not quite right based on the original wording: \"John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris.\"\n# This implies if his well-attended wedding is NOT in July, THEN he travels to Paris.\n# Let's assume the \"well-attended wedding\" is a singular event for the premise.\n# If John has a well-attended wedding `w`: then (`OccursInJuly(w)` OR `TravelsToParis(john)`).\n# This still implies `HasWedding(john)` and `WellAttended(w)` and `BelongsTo(w, john)`.\n\n# The simplest fix is to assume the rule means:\n# If there exists a wedding `w` that John has AND `w` is well-attended,\n# THEN (there exists a wedding `w_j` that John has AND `w_j` occurs in July) OR (`TravelsToParis(john)`).\n# This is `(\u2203w (BelongsTo(w, john) \u2227 WellAttended(w))) \u2192 ( (\u2203w' (BelongsTo(w', john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w'))) \u2228 TravelsToParis(john) )`\n\n# Let's reconsider the original problematic predicate `WeddingInJuly(x)`.
