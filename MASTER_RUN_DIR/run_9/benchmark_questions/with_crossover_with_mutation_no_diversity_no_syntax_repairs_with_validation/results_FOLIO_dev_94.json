It should either be universally or existentially quantified.\n# If it means for *any* deposit amount y, then `\u2200y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2192 y \u2264 1500)`. This is too strong.\n# If it means there *exists* a deposit amount y, then `\u2203y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 y \u2264 1500)`. This is likely the intent.\n\n# Let's assume the standard interpretation that `DepositAmount(x, y)` implies existence and reference to a deposit amount for building `x`.\n# So, `DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 y \u2264 1500` means \"the deposit for x is y AND y is <= 1500\".\n# If a building can have multiple deposit amounts (which is unlikely for rent), then existential quantification is needed.\n# Assuming a single deposit amount for a building, the original form is acceptable.\n\n# Let's simplify predicates slightly if possible.\n# `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x)` and `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)` can be derived from `DepositAmount` and `RentAmount` and comparison operators.\n# For example, `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x)` \u2194 `\u2203d (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 d = RentAmount(x, r))`.\n# However, these are already defined.\n\n# Let's add a premise that makes the deposit amount for Olive Garden concrete, based on the rent.\n# The scenario implies a connection between rent and deposit for managed buildings.\n# \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# If `DepositRequired(oliveGarden)` and `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`, and we assume the deposit is at least the rent amount because it's required and \"equal to or more\", we can infer more.\n# Let's add an explicit premise for Olive Garden's deposit amount, which seems to be implied by the rent.\n# If the deposit is \"equal to one month's rent or more\", and the rent is $2000, and $2000 is more than $1500.\n# It's highly implied that the deposit for Olive Garden is $2000, making DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) true.\n# Let's add this explicit fact to make the scenario fully concrete.\n\n# Adding explicit deposit amount for Olive Garden.\n# Since RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), and \"deposit can be equal to one month's rent or more\",\n# and \"2000$ is more than $1500\", and we want to check if Tom rents.\n# The most natural interpretation is DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# This makes DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) true.\n\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# This implies DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) because RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and MoreThan(2000, 2000) is false, but DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) means DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true.\n# AND DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and MoreThan(2000, 1500).\n\n# Let's re-check the Tom renting condition:\n# \u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 DepositAmount(b, y) \u2227 y \u2264 1500))).\n# For oliveGarden, this would be:\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 DepositAmount(oliveGarden, y) \u2227 y \u2264 1500).\n# With DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), this becomes:\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 2000 \u2264 1500).\n# Since 2000 \u2264 1500 is false, `Rent(tom, oliveGarden)` will be false, regardless of `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)`.\n\n# This seems consistent.

The current encoding has:\n# `\u2200x \u2200y (ManagedBuilding(y) \u2227 Pet(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(x, y))` which is too strong.\n# And `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 DepositRequired(x) \u2192 \u00acAllowedPet(fluffy, x))` which is also problematic.\n# If a building is managed and a deposit is required, *then* Fluffy is NOT allowed? This seems counter-intuitive.\n# Usually, pets are allowed if a deposit is paid.\n# The phrasing \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings\" suggests it's a property of certain buildings,\n# not a universal rule.\n\n# Let's re-interpret:\n# 1. Pets *can* be allowed in managed buildings.\n# 2. Renting in a managed building requires a deposit.\n# 3. Deposit is >= 1 month's rent.\n# 4. Tom rents if Fluffy allowed AND deposit <= 1500.\n# 5. Olive Garden is managed, rent $2000.\n# 6. $2000 > $1500.\n\n# Let's assume `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)` is true because Olive Garden is a managed building.\n# This is an assumption based on typical scenarios, as the text isn't explicit.\n# However, the existing rules try to infer `AllowedPet`.\n\n# Let's explicitly state the deposit amount for Olive Garden.\n# The original program uses `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d)` and then `MoreThan(2000, 1500)`.\n# It also has `\u2200x \u2200y (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2227 RentAmount(x, y) \u2192 DepositAmount(x, y))`.\n# And `\u2200x \u2200y (DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x) \u2227 RentAmount(x, y) \u2192 MoreThan(DepositAmount(x, y), y))`.\n# And `\u2200x \u2200y (DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x) \u2227 RentAmount(x, y) \u2192 LessThan(y, DepositAmount(x, y)))`.\n# The sentence \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\" implies\n# DepositAmount(x, Y) where Y = RentAmount(x) OR Y > RentAmount(x).\n# For Olive Garden, RentAmount is 2000. So DepositAmount is either 2000 or > 2000.\n# The text says \"2000$ is more than $1500\".

must be less than or equal to 1500.\n# For Olive Garden, DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# LessThanEqualTo(2000, 1500) is FALSE.\n# So Tom will not rent at Olive Garden.\n\n# This revised program is more explicit about the relationships between rent and deposit amounts and how they affect Tom's decision.\n# It also clarifies the \"no more than $1500\" condition.\n\n# Final check on the problem statement's constraints:\n# - Fix bugs: The original `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` was a bug. Fixed with `LessThanEqualTo(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)`.\n# - Add missing edge-cases: The explicit definition of `LessThanEqualTo` and the explicit setting of `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` help clarify reasoning.\n# - Simplify logic: The logic is structured clearly with explicit premises.\n\n# Consider if `Rent(tom, x)` should be implied by `MoveIn(tom, x)`. The current premise uses `Rent(tom, x)`.\n# The scenario states \"Tom will rent an apartment...\". So `Rent(tom, x)` is the correct predicate.\n\n# The premise `\u2203x \u2203y (ManagedBuilding(y) \u2227 AllowedPet(x, y))` is a general statement.\n# We don't have an explicit example of this in the scenario, but it's a general fact.\n# If we omit it, we are removing a premise from the original program.\n# Let's keep it for fidelity to the original program's content.\n\n# One final thought on `LessThanEqualTo(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` vs `LessThanEqualTo(DepositAmount(x), 1500)` if DepositAmount was a function.\n# With `DepositAmount(x, y)` meaning y is the amount, the current formulation is correct, meaning \"the deposit amount is less than or equal to 1500\".\n\n# Final set of premises:\n\n===========================================\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",
