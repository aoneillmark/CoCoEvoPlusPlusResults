RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n#   Since 1800 < 2000, this means `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` is false, and `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` is false.\n#   This contradicts the rule \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n#   Therefore, the deposit for Olive Garden must be >= 2000.\n#   So, `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) \u2192 MoreThan(d, 2000) \u2228 Equal(d, 2000)`.\n#   Combining with `\u2200x (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, x) \u2192 MoreThan(x, 1500))`, we can infer:\n#   `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) \u2192 (MoreThan(d, 2000) \u2228 Equal(d, 2000))`\n#   This implies `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` or `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)`.\n#   Since we know `MoreThan(d, 1500)` and `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`, and the deposit must be equal to or more than rent, it must be that `d >= 2000`.\n#   This satisfies `d > 1500`.\n#   So, `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` is true OR `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` is true.\n\n# Tom's condition: security deposit is no more than $1500.\n# For Olive Garden, the deposit is >= 2000.\n# So, Tom will NOT rent at Olive Garden because the deposit condition (<= 1500) is not met.\n# `\u00ac(\u2200y (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, y) \u2192 \u00acMoreThan(y, 1500)))` is true.\n# Because `\u2200y (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, y) \u2192 MoreThan(y, 2000))` is implied.\n\n# Let's add `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)` as a premise to make the scenario more complete, assuming Tom would consider it if the deposit was okay.\n# Or, more logically, if we want to infer whether Tom rents, we need to know if he's allowed to move in.\n# The problem doesn't state pets are *always* allowed in managed buildings.\n\n# Let's refine the predicates and premises for clarity and correctness.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",

The original implies this is general knowledge about Tom's pets and buildings he rents, but it's also possible to interpret it as: if Tom owns a pet, that pet is allowed in *any* managed building he might rent.)\n# For this revision, we'll assume the more specific interpretation: Fluffy is allowed in *any* managed building Tom rents.\n# However, the original rule was \u2200x (OwnedPet(fluffy, x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x)), which is syntactically incorrect.

Let's use a more specific rule that connects ownership to being allowed for Fluffy specifically.\n\n# If Tom owns Fluffy, Fluffy is allowed in any managed building Tom rents.\n# A more direct encoding might be: AllowedPet(fluffy, x) is true if Tom owns Fluffy and x is a managed building Tom rents.\n# However, the rule is about *renting* based on being allowed.\n# Let's assume the simpler interpretation that Fluffy is allowed in managed buildings because Tom owns her.\n# The premise \"\u2200x (OwnedPet(fluffy, x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x))\" is malformed (OwnedPet is not defined) and likely meant \"\u2200x (Owns(tom, x) \u2227 Fluffy(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(x, y))\" where y is a building.\n# Given the context, a strong implication is: If Tom owns Fluffy, Fluffy is allowed in managed buildings where Tom might rent.\n# Let's stick to the information given without adding new relationships.\n# The scenario states \"Fluffy is Tom's cat.\" and \"Cats are pets.\" and \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\"\n# It also states \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy\".\n# The missing piece is why Fluffy *is* allowed or not. The original program had \"\u2200x (OwnedPet(fluffy, x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x))\", let's assume this was meant to be \"If Tom owns Fluffy, then Fluffy is allowed in buildings he might rent.\"\n# Let's make the premise explicitly about Fluffy being allowed for Tom:\nAllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) # This is an assumption derived from the desire to rent. If he rents, he must be allowed.\n\n# The security deposit for Olive Garden is $2000, and the rent is $2000.\n# The security deposit must be equal to one month's rent or more.\n# For Olive Garden, the deposit amount is $2000. Rent is $2000.\n# This implies DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) should be true, and also that the deposit is not *more than* one month's rent.\n# The premise \"\u2200x (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, x) \u2192 MoreThan(x, 1500))\" means the deposit at Olive Garden is > $1500. Since rent is $2000, and deposit must be >= rent or = rent, this is consistent.\n# Let's ensure the specific deposit amount for Olive Garden is captured.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# And the rent is captured.\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# The rule about deposit being equal or more than rent:\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 \u2203y \u2203z (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 RentAmount(x, z) \u2227 (Equal(y, z) \u2228 MoreThan(y, z))))\n# Specific instance for Olive Garden:\n# Since DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), then Equal(2000, 2000) is true.\n# This implies DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true.\nDepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)\n# And it cannot be DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) if it's equal.\n# The premise \"\u2200x (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, x) \u2192 MoreThan(x, 1500))\" is explicitly given for Olive Garden.\n# This means DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) implies MoreThan(2000, 1500), which is true.\n# This premise also implies that DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is *not* LessThan(2000, 1500).\n\n# Explicitly state that Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden, as Tom wants to rent there.\n# The condition for renting is being allowed with Fluffy. If Tom is to rent, he must be allowed with Fluffy.\n# The problem implies that Tom will rent if conditions are met. We are asked to encode the scenario.\n# The scenario implies that Tom *can* rent if conditions are met. For Olive Garden, the deposit is $2000 (which is > $1500), so he cannot rent there.\n# This means AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) must be FALSE if Tom rents there.\n# BUT, the condition is \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building IF AND ONLY IF he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, AND the security deposit is no more than $1500.\"\n# For Olive Garden:\n# DepositAmount is $2000.\n# $2000 is NOT no more than $1500.\n# So, Tom will NOT rent an apartment in Olive Garden.\n# This means that even if AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) is TRUE, he won't rent due to the deposit.\n# If AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) is FALSE, he also won't rent.\n# The scenario doesn't state whether Fluffy *is* allowed in Olive Garden, only the conditions for Tom renting.\n\n# Let's refine the understanding of the last rule:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u2203y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 LessThan(y, 1500)))))\n# For OliveGarden:\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# Is LessThan(2000, 1500)? No.\n# So, the condition `\u2203y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 LessThan(y, 1500))` is FALSE for OliveGarden.\n# Therefore, `Rent(tom, oliveGarden)` is FALSE, regardless of `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)`.\n\n# The original program had an explicit rule: \"\u2200x (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, x) \u2192 MoreThan(x, 1500))\".\n# This means for Olive Garden, the deposit is > $1500.\n# Let's make sure this is captured accurately.\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is given.\n# MoreThan(2000, 1500) is given.\n# This confirms the premise holds for Olive Garden.\n\n# What is missing is a direct statement about AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden).\n# The problem states \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\"\n# And \"Fluffy is Tom's cat.\" and \"Cats are pets.\"\n# The rule for renting implies `AllowedPet(fluffy, x)` must be true for Tom to rent.\n# But we know he *won't* rent Olive Garden.\n# So, we cannot infer `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)` from the renting condition for Olive Garden.\n# The original premise \"\u2200x (OwnedPet(fluffy, x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x))\" was likely an attempt to state this.\n# Let's assume, for completeness, that Fluffy *is* allowed in managed buildings where Tom might be considered to rent.\n# The safest is to NOT infer AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) from Tom's renting conditions, as those conditions are not met.\n# The premise \"\u2200x (OwnedPet(fluffy, x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x))\" was syntactically incorrect.\n# A more robust way to state that Tom's pet is allowed, if the scenario implies it generally, would be:\n# \u2200x (Fluffy(x) \u2192 \u2200y (ManagedBuilding(y) \u2192 AllowedPet(x, y)))\n# But this might be too strong an inference.\n# Let's consider that the prompt wants minimal changes for correctness.\n# The main issue in the original was the malformed `OwnedPet` predicate.\n\n# If we assume the scenario implies Fluffy is *generally* allowed in managed buildings (because Tom owns her and she's a pet), we can add:\n# For all pets P and all managed buildings B, if Tom owns P, then P is allowed in B.\n# \u2200p \u2200b (Owns(tom, p) \u2227 Pet(p) \u2227 ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 AllowedPet(p, b))\n# Applying this to Fluffy:\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nPet(fluffy) # Derived from Cat(fluffy)\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nTherefore, AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) must be true based on this derived rule.\nLet's include this explicit rule.\n\n\u2200p \u2200b (Owns(tom, p) \u2227 Pet(p) \u2227 ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 AllowedPet(p, b))\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the rent condition for Olive Garden:\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 \u2203y (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, y) \u2227 LessThan(y, 1500)))\n# We have:\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# Is LessThan(2000, 1500)?

The rule for renting depends on being allowed with Fluffy.\n# For Olive Garden, the deposit is too high. So Tom won't rent.\n\n# The premise \"\u2200x (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, x) \u2192 MoreThan(x, 1500))\" means the deposit is strictly greater than $1500.\n# This implies the deposit is NOT less than or equal to $1500.\n# This directly negates the `LessThan(y, 1500)` part of the rent condition.\n\n# To fix the original program:\n# 1. `\u2200x (OwnedPet(fluffy, x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x))` is malformed.
