Simplifying logic can mean removing ambiguity.\n\n# Let's try to keep the spirit of the original information while resolving the bug.\n# The original program *did not* include the constraint about Texas mines not being donated.

Picuris is in NM or TX.\n# 2. Harding mine is in Picuris.\n# 3. Harding mine is donated.\n# 4. Mines in TX are not donated.\n# If Picuris is in TX (1), then Harding mine is in TX (2).\n# This means Harding mine is a mine in TX (3).\n# According to (4), it should NOT be donated.\n# But (3) says it IS donated. Contradiction.\n\n# To fix this, we must ensure that the case where Picuris is in Texas is ruled out, given the other facts.\n# Thus, we must infer `\u00acLocatedIn(PicurisMountains, Texas)`.\n# Combined with `(LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico) | LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, Texas))`, this implies `LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico)`.\n\n# So, the most direct fix and simplification of logic is to assert the consequence of the contradiction:\n# Remove `(LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico) | LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, Texas))` and replace it with `LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico)`.\n# And since the constraint `\u2200x (Mine(x) \u2227 LocatedIn(x, Texas) \u2192 \u00acDonated(x))` is what *causes* this deduction, and the deduction resolves the contradiction, we can potentially remove the constraint itself if it's no longer necessary to be an explicit premise to derive the facts.\n# However, the constraint is a piece of information from the scenario. The prompt asks to satisfy the *same problem*, implying preserving the essence of the information.\n# Keeping the constraint and also stating `LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico)` makes the premises consistent and highlights the deduction.\n\n# Let's try keeping the constraint and also stating the deduced location.

Simplifying logic can mean removing ambiguity.\n\n# Let's try to keep the spirit of the original information while resolving the bug.\n# The original program *did not* include the constraint about Texas mines not being donated.

Picuris is in NM or TX.\n# 2. Harding mine is in Picuris.\n# 3. Harding mine is donated.\n# 4. Mines in TX are not donated.\n# If Picuris is in TX (1), then Harding mine is in TX (2).\n# This means Harding mine is a mine in TX (3).\n# According to (4), it should NOT be donated.\n# But (3) says it IS donated. Contradiction.\n\n# To fix this, we must ensure that the case where Picuris is in Texas is ruled out, given the other facts.\n# Thus, we must infer `\u00acLocatedIn(PicurisMountains, Texas)`.\n# Combined with `(LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico) | LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, Texas))`, this implies `LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico)`.\n\n# So, the most direct fix and simplification of logic is to assert the consequence of the contradiction:\n# Remove `(LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico) | LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, Texas))` and replace it with `LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico)`.\n# And since the constraint `\u2200x (Mine(x) \u2227 LocatedIn(x, Texas) \u2192 \u00acDonated(x))` is what *causes* this deduction, and the deduction resolves the contradiction, we can potentially remove the constraint itself if it's no longer necessary to be an explicit premise to derive the facts.\n# However, the constraint is a piece of information from the scenario. The prompt asks to satisfy the *same problem*, implying preserving the essence of the information.\n# Keeping the constraint and also stating `LocatedIn(PicurisMountains, NewMexico)` makes the premises consistent and highlights the deduction.\n\n# Let's try keeping the constraint and also stating the deduced location.
