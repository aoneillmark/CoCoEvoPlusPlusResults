The scenario also states Mike needs CPT if he wants to work.\n# This implies Mike must secure CPT. If Mike has F1, the condition \"CPT or OPT\" is satisfied by needing CPT.\n# The scenario information \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is directly addressed by the F1 rule if Mike has F1.\n# Given Mike is an international student in the US, it's reasonable to infer he has an F1 visa, as that's the visa type discussed for working.\n# If F1Visa(mike) is asserted, the F1 rule directly applies.\n# The premise NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) can be inferred from Work(mike) and the F1 rule if we assume Mike has F1.\n# If we want to keep the explicit statement about Mike needing CPT, it should be a derivable fact or a direct rule.\n# The phrasing \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is a strong direct statement.\n# Let's reconcile this by ensuring the F1 rule covers this requirement if Mike has F1.\n# If Mike has F1, Work(mike), US(mike), InternationalStudent(mike), then NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT()) is true.\n# The specific statement about Mike needing CPT is crucial.\n# The revised approach is to focus on the F1 rule and Mike's specific requirement.\n# Let's assume the problem implies Mike has an F1 visa to enable him to work under the described conditions.\n# If Mike has F1, US, is IntlStudent, and Wants to Work:\n# From the F1 rule: NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT()) is true.\n# The scenario also states: Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work. This can be modeled as a specific fact or derivable outcome for Mike.\n# The presence of `F1Visa(mike)` makes the F1 rule applicable.\n# The premise `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())` from the original Parent A can be seen as the specific outcome.\n# Let's keep the F1 rule and ensure Mike's specific need for CPT is encoded.\n# The most precise way to handle \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" given he has F1 is that CPT is a required outcome.\n# This implies that the \"or OPT\" part of the F1 rule is resolved to CPT for Mike.\n# The addition of `F1Visa(mike)` clarifies the applicability of the F1 rule to Mike, and the implication is that CPT is the necessary application.\n# The explicit premise `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())` from Parent A was a strong statement. If we assume it is a consequence, it needs to be derived.\n# By adding `F1Visa(mike)` and keeping the F1 rule, and considering the scenario \"Mike needs to apply for CPT\", we infer that CPT is necessary.\n# If we are to keep the rule, \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\", and he has F1, it implies CPT is mandatory.\n# The general rule \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) from Parent A is removed because it is too broad and doesn't account for the choice aspect of the F1 rule. The F1 rule and Mike's specific requirement are sufficient.\n# The premise `Person(mike)` is also kept from Parent A.\n# `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())` is a derivable consequence from `Work(mike)` and `F1Visa(mike)` combined with the F1 rule and the specific scenario statement about Mike.\n# To avoid explicit redundant statements, and focusing on logical rules:\n# If Mike has F1, works, etc., then CPT or OPT.\n# The statement about Mike needing CPT can be interpreted as CPT being the specific requirement for him.\n# Therefore, the combination of F1 rule and Mike's specific requirement means CPT is needed.\n# The explicit premise `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())` from Parent A is removed as it can be derived if we have `F1Visa(mike)` and the scenario's explicit statement about Mike.\n# However, to directly capture \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\", a rule like `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` is very direct.\n# The prompt asks to merge strengths. Parent A had the explicit `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`.\n# Parent B had the F1 rule with OPT.\n# Let's use the F1 rule and the specific requirement for Mike.\n# Given Mike wants to work, and has F1, he needs CPT or OPT.\n# And he needs CPT. This means CPT is necessary.\n# To simplify, we can make `F1Visa(mike)` a premise, then the F1 rule applies.

This includes F1 students.\n# Rule 1 states that F1 students need CPT *or* OPT.\n# If Rule 2 is true, then F1 students need CPT. This is consistent with Rule 1 because CPT is one of the options in CPT \u2228 OPT.\n# The problem statement for Mike: `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` is given as a premise. This is identical to Rule 2.\n\n# So, the original code has:\n# General rule for F1: Needs CPT or OPT.\n# General rule for ALL international students: Needs CPT.\n# Specific premise for Mike (which is the same as the general rule for ALL international students): Needs CPT.\n\n# The most direct simplification is to remove the general rule that is directly stated as a premise for Mike and is also redundant with the F1 rule if interpreted strictly.\n# The problem statement: \"An international student in US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.\"\n# This statement implies that for F1 students, it is a choice between CPT and OPT.\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" is a very specific requirement for Mike.\n\n# Let's remove premise 6 as it's redundant with the specific rule for Mike.\n# If Mike has F1, then P5 applies: Needs CPT or OPT.\n# And Mike *needs* CPT.\n# This means Mike must obtain CPT. The OPT part of P5 is then irrelevant for Mike if he has F1.\n# If Mike has J1, then P5 doesn't apply. But Mike still needs CPT by his specific premise.\n\n# Therefore, the logic is consistent. The simplification is removing the redundant general rule.\n\n# New Program:\n# Premises:\n# InternationalStudent(mike)\n# US(mike)\n# Person(mike)\n# Work(mike)\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n# # Removed the general rule: \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# # This is because the specific premise for Mike already covers this, and keeping it makes the F1 rule less distinct if Mike has F1.\n# # The problem statement about Mike \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is a direct premise about Mike.\n# # The problem statement about F1 students \"An international student in US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work\"\n# # specifies a choice for F1 students.\n# # By removing the general rule that requires CPT for ALL international students wanting to work, we preserve the choice aspect for F1 students.\n# # Mike's specific premise ensures he needs CPT regardless of his visa type.\n# # If Mike has F1, he needs CPT or OPT (from F1 rule) AND he needs CPT (from his specific premise).\n# # This means he *must* obtain CPT.\n# # If Mike has J1, he just needs CPT (from his specific premise).\n\n# The core issue in the original was the redundancy between the general rule for all international students needing CPT and the specific rule for Mike which is identical, and how this interacts with the F1 rule.\n# The proposed change removes the general rule that is identical to Mike's specific premise, simplifying the set of rules.\n\n# Let's rewrite the premises clearly.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
