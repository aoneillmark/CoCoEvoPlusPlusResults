However, to maintain original vocabulary, we keep it.\n# The original rule `\u2200x (Book(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Knowledge(y) \u2227 Contains(x, y)))` is now superseded by `\u2200x (Book(x) \u2192 Knowledge(x))`.\n# The predicate `Knowledge(x)` is still useful to represent that a thing *is* knowledge, not just that it's contained.\n# The predicate `Contains(x, y)` is now effectively unused in the derived rules.\n# Let's refine the first general rule to be more specific if the intent was that books contain *specific pieces of knowledge*.\n# If the intent was that a book has *some* knowledge, but not necessarily the book itself *is* that knowledge, we revert to the original style but clean it up.\n\n# Let's revert to a more direct interpretation and simplify where possible, focusing on the provided scenario.\n\n# General Rules:\n# Rule 1: Books contain knowledge.\n# Simplification: Instead of `\u2203y`, let's make it explicit that a book *is* a source of knowledge.\n# \u2200x (Book(x) \u2192 Knowledge(x)) # A book is a type of knowledge.\n# If we must use `Contains`, then:\n\u2200x (Book(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Knowledge(y) \u2227 Contains(x, y))) # This is fine as is.\n\n# Rule 2: Reading a book grants knowledge.\n# Simplification: The original rule `\u2200x \u2200y ((Person(x) \u2227 Reads(x, y) \u2227 Book(y)) \u2192 Gains(x, Knowledge(y)))` is a bit awkward because `Knowledge(y)` is not a standard way to refer to an entity.\n# If `y` is a book, then `Knowledge(y)` would imply `y` itself is knowledge.\n# Let's assume `Gains(x, y)` means \"x gains y\".
