If the definition of hardship were more granular and dependent on multiple factors that are not all met, then `Prove(Tom, EconomicHardship)` would be false. This model assumes the scenario guarantees this proof.\n# - The cost of the GRE is mentioned but not used in the aid provision logic, which is typical for aid systems.\n# - The scenario is about Tom specifically.
