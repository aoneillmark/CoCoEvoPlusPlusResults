Beijing is the most populous city among all national capitals.\n# 2. Beijing is the most populous capital of its country, and its country is populous.\n# The current encoding reflects interpretation 1 by Populous(beijing) and NationalCapital(beijing, china).\n# If interpretation 2 was intended, we might need a predicate like `MostPopulousCapitalOf(x, y)` where y is a country.\n# Given the phrasing, interpretation 1 is more likely intended.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac(\u2203x (Country(x) \u2227 NationalCapital(beijing, x) \u2227 Populous(x)))\n",
