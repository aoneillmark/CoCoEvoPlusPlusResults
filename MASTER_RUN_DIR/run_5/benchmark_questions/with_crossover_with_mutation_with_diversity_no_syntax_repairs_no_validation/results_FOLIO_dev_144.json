The entities it operates on are domestic animals.\n# We can use a predicate `InvolvesDomesticAnimals(x)` or similar, or assume that the definition of `SelectiveBreeding` implicitly means it's applied to domestic animals.\n# For simplification, let's assume `SelectiveBreeding(x)` implies `x` is a process applied to domestic animals.\n# We can introduce `DomesticAnimal(x)` and link it to the process.\n# Let's redefine `SelectiveBreeding(x)` to mean 'x is a selective breeding process'.\n# And `SelectiveBreedingProcess(p) \u2192 InvolvesDomesticAnimals(p, z)`\n\n# Given the context \"deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\", we can simplify.\n# If x is ArtificialSelection, it must be a type of SelectiveBreeding.\n# And SelectiveBreeding implies it's a deliberate act involving domestic animals.\n# Let's introduce `DomesticAnimal(x)`.\n# And define `SelectiveBreeding(x)` to implicitly mean it involves domestic animals and is deliberate.\n# This simplifies the connection without needing a new binary relation on `SelectiveBreeding`.\n# So, `ArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)` is sufficient if `SelectiveBreeding` carries the meaning of \"deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\".\n\n# The predicate `ToBreedBack(x)` seems to denote a category of animals.\n# The last premise states: \"Some animals to be bred back resemble animals that are extinct.\"\n# This means there exists at least one animal 'x' such that 'x' is to be bred back, 'x' is an animal, and 'x' resembles some animal 'y' which is extinct.\n# This premise is already represented well.\n\n# Let's ensure all explicitly mentioned entities are typed correctly.\n# Heck cattle is an animal.\n# Aurochs is an animal.\n# The problem implies that the *process* of breeding back is a form of artificial selection.\n# So, `BreedingBack(x)` should refer to the process or instance of breeding back.\n# The premise `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` indicates an event.\n# Let's align `BreedingBack(x)` with the concept that `x` is an entity that has been bred back.\n# So, `HeckCattle(x) \u2192 BreedingBack(x)` is a good inference.\n# And `BreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x)` means any entity that has been bred back is an instance of artificial selection.\n# And `ArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)` means any instance of artificial selection is a selective breeding.\n\n# The premise `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` is problematic.\n# It introduces `DomesticAnimals` (which is not in the predicate list) and a relation `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)`.\n# Let's assume `DomesticAnimals` should be `DomesticAnimal` and it's a type, not a relation.\n# And `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` is meant to say that the selective breeding process `x` applies to domestic animal `y`.\n# A simpler way: If `x` is a `SelectiveBreeding` process, it's a deliberate breeding of domestic animals.\n# We can use `IsDomesticAnimal(y)` and `DeliberateBreedingProcess(x, y)`.\n# Or, if `SelectiveBreeding(x)` means 'x is a selective breeding process', then it implies deliberation and application to domestic animals.\n# Let's use `DomesticAnimal(y)` and a relation `Of(x, y)` meaning 'x is of y'.\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 Deliberate(x) \u2227 DomesticAnimal(y) \u2227 Of(x, y)` This seems too complex.\n\n# Let's simplify based on the phrasing: \"deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\".\n# This suggests `SelectiveBreeding` implies deliberation and involves domestic animals.\n# We can infer:\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 Deliberate(x)`\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 Involves(x, DomesticAnimal)`  (This is tricky to model without new predicates or assumptions)\n\n# Let's stick closer to the current predicates and fix the logic.\n# The original implies a chain: BreedingBack -> ArtificialSelection -> SelectiveBreeding\n# Let's assume `BreedingBack(x)` means x is an entity that has undergone breeding back.\n# `HeckCattle(x) \u2192 BreedingBack(x)`\n# `BreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x)` (This implies the *instance* or *entity* is artificial selection)\n# `ArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)` (This implies the *instance* or *entity* is selective breeding)\n# The problematic premise: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`\n# This suggests `SelectiveBreeding` is a process that *acts upon* domestic animals.\n# Let's introduce `DomesticAnimal(y)` as a type.\n# And `SelectiveBreedingProcess(x)` as a type of process.\n# Then `SelectiveBreedingProcess(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimal(y) \u2227 ActsOn(x, y))`\n# However, the current model uses `SelectiveBreeding(x)` for the *entity*.\n\n# Simplification: Assume `SelectiveBreeding(x)` means 'x is a selective breeding instance/entity'.\n# And this inherently means it's a deliberate process applied to domestic animals.\n# So, the premise `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` is redundant if `SelectiveBreeding(x)` already carries that meaning.\n# If `SelectiveBreeding(x)` means \"x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\", then the existential is implied.\n# Let's remove the problematic premise and refine the chain.\n\n# Revised Premise Logic:\n# 1. Heck cattle is an animal. (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\n# 2. Aurochs is an animal. (Aurochs(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\n# 3. Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s. (BredBack(heckCattle, 1920s))\n#    - Implies Heck cattle is an instance of something that has been bred back. Let's use `HasBeenBredBack(x)`.\n#    - So, `BredBack(x, y)` implies `HasBeenBredBack(x)`.\n#    - `BredBack(heckCattle, 1920s)` implies `HasBeenBredBack(heckCattle)`.\n\n# 4. Breeding back is a form of artificial selection.\n#    - If `x` has been bred back, then `x` is an instance of artificial selection.\n#    - `HasBeenBredBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x)`\n\n# 5. Artificial selection is a form of deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.\n#    - If `x` is artificial selection, then `x` is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.\n#    - `ArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)`\n#    - And `SelectiveBreeding(x)` implies `Deliberate(x)` and `InvolvesDomesticAnimals(x)`.\n#      We don't need to explicitly state `Deliberate` and `InvolvesDomesticAnimals` as separate predicates if `SelectiveBreeding` already encapsulates this meaning.\n\n# 6. Heck cattle resemble aurochs. (Resemble(heckCattle, aurochs))\n\n# 7.
