(Not explicitly stated, but implied by context for blocking/shooting rules)\n# 3. Anyone in Michael's class is a Shooter and does not Jump. (This is a strong assumption not directly supported, so sticking to the explicit rule is better).\n\n# Revised Blocking Rule for Michael:\n# From \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# and \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.\"\n# We know if Michael blocks x, then \u00acJump(x).\n# And for any x, if Shooter(x) and \u00acJump(x), then Block(michael, x).\n# The exception is Windy.\n\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2227 \u00acWindy(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n# This ensures Michael cannot block Windy.\n\n# Re-evaluating the first premise:\n# \u2200x \u2200y ((Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y)) \u2192 Block(x, y))\n# This is too broad. The scenario specifies \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# This suggests a direct relationship between being taller and blocking.\n# Given Michael is taller than everyone else in his class:\n# \u2200x (Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Block(michael, x)) should be sufficient for Michael.\n# The scenario doesn't provide similar broad rules for Peter or Windy's blocking capabilities based on height.\n# So, removing the general Man-to-Man blocking rule and relying on specific Michael blocking rules.\n\n# Final Premises based on analysis:\n\u2200x (Michael(x) \u2192 Man(x))\n\u2200x (Peter(x) \u2192 Man(x))\n\u2200x (Windy(x) \u2192 Person(x))\n\nTaller(peter, michael)\n\u2200x (Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Class(x))\n\n# Michael can block anyone he is taller than.\n\u2200x (Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n\n# Michael can block shooters who don't jump.\n\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n\n# Michael cannot block Windy.\n\u00acBlock(michael, windy)\n\n# Shooters who jump are great shooters.\n\u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 Jump(x) \u2192 GreatShooter(x))\n\n# Transitivity of Taller.\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z ((Taller(x, y) \u2227 Taller(y, z)) \u2192 Taller(x, z))\n\n# Inferring some facts for clarity based on the scenario description:\n# Michael is taller than everyone in his class.\n# Since Peter is taller than Michael, and Michael is taller than everyone in his class, Peter is taller than everyone in Michael's class.\n# This doesn't directly lead to new explicit premises unless we define 'everyone in his class' as a set.\n\n# Simplification:\n# The rule \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting\" implies that Michael can block 'x' IF 'x' is a shooter AND 'x' does not jump.\n# However, the statement \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" acts as an exception.\n# Thus, the previous formulation: \u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2227 \u00acWindy(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x)) is more accurate if we consider Windy might be a shooter who doesn't jump.\n\n# Let's refine the premises once more for clarity and minimal redundancy.\n\n# Conclusion:\nGreatShooter(windy)\n",

Michael, Peter, and Windy are all Persons. (Implicitly handled by specific predicates)\n# 2. Michael, Peter, and Windy are all Shooters. (Not explicitly stated, but implied by context for blocking/shooting rules)\n# 3. Anyone in Michael's class is a Shooter and does not Jump. (This is a strong assumption not directly supported, so sticking to the explicit rule is better).\n\n# Revised Blocking Rule for Michael:\n# From \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# and \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.\"\n# We know if Michael blocks x, then \u00acJump(x).\n# And for any x, if Shooter(x) and \u00acJump(x), then Block(michael, x).\n# The exception is Windy.\n\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2227 \u00acWindy(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n# This ensures Michael cannot block Windy.\n\n# Re-evaluating the first premise:\n# \u2200x \u2200y ((Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y)) \u2192 Block(x, y))\n# This is too broad. The scenario specifies \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# This suggests a direct relationship between being taller and blocking.\n# Given Michael is taller than everyone else in his class:\n# \u2200x (Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Block(michael, x)) should be sufficient for Michael.\n# The scenario doesn't provide similar broad rules for Peter or Windy's blocking capabilities based on height.\n# So, removing the general Man-to-Man blocking rule and relying on specific Michael blocking rules.\n\n# Final Premises based on analysis:\n\u2200x (Michael(x) \u2192 Man(x))\n\u2200x (Peter(x) \u2192 Man(x))\n\u2200x (Windy(x) \u2192 Person(x))\n\nTaller(peter, michael)\n\u2200x (Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Class(x))\n\n# Michael can block anyone he is taller than.\n\u2200x (Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n\n# Michael can block shooters who don't jump.\n\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n\n# Michael cannot block Windy.\n\u00acBlock(michael, windy)\n\n# Shooters who jump are great shooters.\n\u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 Jump(x) \u2192 GreatShooter(x))\n\n# Transitivity of Taller.\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z ((Taller(x, y) \u2227 Taller(y, z)) \u2192 Taller(x, z))\n\n# Inferring some facts for clarity based on the scenario description:\n# Michael is taller than everyone in his class.\n# Since Peter is taller than Michael, and Michael is taller than everyone in his class, Peter is taller than everyone in Michael's class.\n# This doesn't directly lead to new explicit premises unless we define 'everyone in his class' as a set.\n\n# Simplification:\n# The rule \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting\" implies that Michael can block 'x' IF 'x' is a shooter AND 'x' does not jump.\n# However, the statement \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" acts as an exception.\n# Thus, the previous formulation: \u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2227 \u00acWindy(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x)) is more accurate if we consider Windy might be a shooter who doesn't jump.\n\n# Let's refine the premises once more for clarity and minimal redundancy.\n\n# Conclusion:\nBlock(peter, windy)\n",

The original premises don't explicitly state Michael is a person, but Man(michael) implies it through \u2200x (Man(x) \u2192 Person(x)).\n# What if Peter is not a man? This is added with Peter(x) \u2192 Man(x).\n# What if Windy is not a person? This is added with Windy(x) \u2192 Person(x).\n# What if a person is taller than another, but not a man? The original premise for blocking requires both to be men.\n# The addition of \u2200x (Man(x) \u2192 Person(x)) makes it clear all men are persons.\n# The premise Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Class(x) implies that anyone Michael is taller than is in his class.\n# The premise \u2200x (Class(x) \u2192 Man(x)) implies everyone in Michael's class is a man.\n# Therefore, if Taller(michael, x), then x is in his class, and thus x is a man. This makes the Taller(x,y) to Block(x,y) premise more useful when x is Michael.\n# For instance, if Taller(michael, x) and Man(x), then Michael can block x's shooting.
