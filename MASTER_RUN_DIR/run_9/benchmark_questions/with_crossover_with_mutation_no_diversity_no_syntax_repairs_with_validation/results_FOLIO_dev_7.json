So a person experiences that condition.\n\n# Revised premise for feeling tired due to glu:\n# If a person has a Glu, they feel tired.\n# Assuming `Glu(x)` means `x` is an instance of the condition 'glu'.\n# And if a person is affected by it.\n\n# Let's assume the original intent of `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, x))`\n# was trying to say: For any person `x`, if `x` is a `Glu` (which is unlikely),\n# then `x` feels tired.\n\n# A more sensible interpretation of \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# If `Person(p)` and `Glu(g)` and `HasCondition(p, g)` then `FeelingTired(p)`.\n# Since we don't have `HasCondition`, let's re-interpret `Glu(x)` as `x is a glu`,\n# and the statement implies that experiencing `Glu` causes tiredness in people.\n# If we treat `Glu` as a predicate applied to a person, then:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This seems to align with the spirit of the problem.\n\n# Let's revise the premise based on this:\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n\n# This makes `Glu` a property that a person can have, leading to tiredness.\n# The original `\u2200x (Glu(x) \u2192 Symptom(x))` is problematic because `Symptom` is not defined as a predicate.\n# Assuming it was meant to be `FeelingTired(x)` or similar.\n# If `Glu(x)` means `x` is a glu, and a glu is a symptom.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is a distinct assertion.\n\n# Let's remove the ambiguous `\u2200x (Glu(x) \u2192 Symptom(x))` and rely on the specific causal statement.\n\n# Final set of premises, aiming for clarity and fixing ambiguities:\n\nMonkeypox(mp)\nInfectiousDisease(mp)\nCausedBy(mp, mp_virus)\nMonkeypoxVirus(mp_virus)\n\n# Virus occurrence\nOccurIn(mp_virus, Human)\n\u2200x (Animal(x) \u2192 OccurIn(mp_virus, x))\n\n# Animal hierarchy\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x))\n\u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\n\n# Monkeypox symptoms\n\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 (SymptomOf(fever, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(headache, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(muscle_pains, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(feeling_tired, x)))\n\n# Human/Person relation\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))\n\n# Glu and its effect on people\n# Interpretation: If a person has a Glu, they feel tired.\n# We treat `Glu` as a condition a person can have.\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",
