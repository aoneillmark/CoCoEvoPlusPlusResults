This is a simplification, but in the absence of a need to reason about *which* Japanese company, it's acceptable.\n- Removed explicit `Game(theLegendOfZelda)` as it's implied by `theLegendOfZelda` being a game.\n- Combined the sale and million predicates into a single, more descriptive predicate `SellMoreThanOneMillion(g)`.\n- Removed `Select(x, y)` and `Top10(x)` and replaced them with `IsInTop10(x)` for simplicity.\n- Replaced the specific instance of `millionCopies` with a conceptual predicate `SellMoreThanOneMillion(g)`.\n- Added `MadeByJapaneseCompany(g)` as a predicate for clarity.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2200g (LegendOfZelda(g) \u2192 \u2203c (Japanese(c) \u2227 Created(c, g)))\n",

Assuming `MadeByJapaneseCompany(g)` implies that a Japanese company created `g`. This is a reasonable simplification given the context.\n- The premise `\u2200g (Game(g) \u2227 Sell(g, millionCopies) \u2227 Million(millionCopies) \u2192 Select(g, Top10))` was simplified to `\u2200g (SellMoreThanOneMillion(g) \u2192 IsInTop10(g))`. This assumes that \"selected into the Top 10 list\" is equivalent to \"is in the Top 10 list\" and that `SellMoreThanOneMillion(g)` captures the condition of selling more than one million copies.\n- The existential quantifier for the creator of the Legend of Zelda was removed in favor of a direct statement with named constants for clarity and simplicity, as the specific company is not central to the logic. This is a simplification, but in the absence of a need to reason about *which* Japanese company, it's acceptable.\n- Removed explicit `Game(theLegendOfZelda)` as it's implied by `theLegendOfZelda` being a game.\n- Combined the sale and million predicates into a single, more descriptive predicate `SellMoreThanOneMillion(g)`.\n- Removed `Select(x, y)` and `Top10(x)` and replaced them with `IsInTop10(x)` for simplicity.\n- Replaced the specific instance of `millionCopies` with a conceptual predicate `SellMoreThanOneMillion(g)`.\n- Added `MadeByJapaneseCompany(g)` as a predicate for clarity.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acTop10(TheLegendOfZelda)\n",
