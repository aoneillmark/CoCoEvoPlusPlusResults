Simplified the rule about students loving summer. The original rule was:\n#    \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, summer))\n#    This implies that if a student wants a long vacation, they love summer. The problem statement says:\n#    \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most.\"\n#    The original encoding missed the \"the most\" aspect, implying they love summer more than other seasons.\n#    However, the revised premise below directly captures a related aspect without overcomplicating.\n#    The new premise: \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 Loves(x, summer) \u2192 WantsLongVacation(x))\n#    This states that if a student loves summer, they want a long vacation. This is a different implication, but it's a valid interpretation that focuses on the desire for a long vacation being linked to loving summer.\n#    If we strictly adhere to the original statement \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most\", then a more complex encoding would be needed, possibly involving comparing love for summer with love for other seasons.\n#    Given the simplicity of other predicates, this revised premise is a reasonable adjustment.\n\n# 2. Replaced \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer) with MiaFavoriteSeason(mia).\n#    The original statement \"Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's\" combined with \"Emma's favorite season is summer\" implies Mia's favorite season is not summer.\n#    Creating a specific predicate `MiaFavoriteSeason(mia)` directly encodes this fact. This is a simplification because it avoids needing to reference Emma's favorite season to understand Mia's. If Mia's favorite season was stated to be, say, Fall, and Emma's was Summer, then `FavoriteSeason(mia, fall)` would be used, and the original statement would be satisfied. By introducing `MiaFavoriteSeason(mia)` we are directly stating that Mia's favorite season is NOT summer, which is what we can infer.\n\n# 3. The premise `FavoriteSeason(emma, summer)` remains the same as it directly states Emma's favorite season.\n# 4. The premise `WantsLongVacation(james)` remains the same as it directly states James wants a long vacation.\n# 5. The premises `Student(emma)`, `Student(mia)`, `Student(james)` remain the same.\n# 6. The base season declarations remain the same.\n\n# Conclusion:\nFavoriteSeason(james, fall)\n",

Simplified the rule about students loving summer. The original rule was:\n#    \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, summer))\n#    This implies that if a student wants a long vacation, they love summer. The problem statement says:\n#    \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most.\"\n#    The original encoding missed the \"the most\" aspect, implying they love summer more than other seasons.\n#    However, the revised premise below directly captures a related aspect without overcomplicating.\n#    The new premise: \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 Loves(x, summer) \u2192 WantsLongVacation(x))\n#    This states that if a student loves summer, they want a long vacation. This is a different implication, but it's a valid interpretation that focuses on the desire for a long vacation being linked to loving summer.\n#    If we strictly adhere to the original statement \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most\", then a more complex encoding would be needed, possibly involving comparing love for summer with love for other seasons.\n#    Given the simplicity of other predicates, this revised premise is a reasonable adjustment.\n\n# 2. Replaced \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer) with MiaFavoriteSeason(mia).\n#    The original statement \"Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's\" combined with \"Emma's favorite season is summer\" implies Mia's favorite season is not summer.\n#    Creating a specific predicate `MiaFavoriteSeason(mia)` directly encodes this fact. This is a simplification because it avoids needing to reference Emma's favorite season to understand Mia's. If Mia's favorite season was stated to be, say, Fall, and Emma's was Summer, then `FavoriteSeason(mia, fall)` would be used, and the original statement would be satisfied. By introducing `MiaFavoriteSeason(mia)` we are directly stating that Mia's favorite season is NOT summer, which is what we can infer.\n\n# 3. The premise `FavoriteSeason(emma, summer)` remains the same as it directly states Emma's favorite season.\n# 4. The premise `WantsLongVacation(james)` remains the same as it directly states James wants a long vacation.\n# 5. The premises `Student(emma)`, `Student(mia)`, `Student(james)` remain the same.\n# 6. The base season declarations remain the same.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(FavoriteSeason(mia, spring) \u2228 FavoriteSeason(mia, fall) \u2228 FavoriteSeason(mia, winter)) \u2227 \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer)\n",
