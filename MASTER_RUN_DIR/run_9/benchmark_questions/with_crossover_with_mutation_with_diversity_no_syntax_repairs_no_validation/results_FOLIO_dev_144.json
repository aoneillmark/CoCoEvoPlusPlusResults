What if an animal to be bred back doesn't resemble an *extinct* animal, but just another animal?\n#    The prompt states: \"Some animals to be bred-back resemble animals that are extinct.\"\n#    This is captured by the existing premise.\n\n# 4. Are there other types of animals bred back? The premise about 'some' implies yes.\n#    No change needed, as the premise already covers 'some'.\n\n# 5. The prompt states \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s\".\n#    The existing premise `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` is good.\n#    However, `BredBack(x, y)` means \"x was bred back in year y\".\n#    This implies `x` is an entity that underwent breeding back.\n#    And `BreedingBack(x)` means \"x is breeding back\" (as a concept/process).\n#    The current premises don't explicitly link an *instance* of something being bred back (`BredBack`)\n#    to the *concept* of breeding back (`BreedingBack`).\n#    Let's add a premise to connect this.\n#    If something (x) was bred back (in any year y), then the concept/process of BreedingBack applies to it.\n#    But the current `BreedingBack(x)` is a bit vague. Is it a process, or an entity?\n#    The prompt says \"Breeding back is a form of artificial selection.\" suggesting it's a concept/process.\n#    Let's re-interpret `BreedingBack(x)` to mean \"x is an instance of breeding back\".\n#    And `BredBack(x, y)` means \"x was the result of breeding back done in year y\".\n#    This implies if `BredBack(x, y)` then `BreedingBack(x)` (as in, x is an outcome of breeding back).\n#    Let's assume `heckCattle` is the *type* of animal that was bred back.\n#    So `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` means the `heckCattle` *type* was the target of this breeding.\n#    This implies that the definition of `HeckCattle` is tied to the process of `BreedingBack`.\n#    Given `HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Animal(x)` and `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)`,\n#    it's reasonable to state that Heck Cattle *are* a result of breeding back.\n#    So, if x is Heck Cattle, then x is an instance of BreedingBack.\nHeckCattle(x) \u2192 BreedingBack(x)\n\n# 6. The predicate `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` seems to be introduced but then `SelectiveBreedingOf(x, y)` is used.\n#    Let's align the predicates for consistency and clarity.\n#    Assuming `SelectiveBreedingOf(x, y)` means 'x is a selective breeding of y'.\n#    Let's update the premise:\n#    SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimal(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreedingOf(x, y))\n#    This implies that 'x' itself is a form of selective breeding, and 'y' are the domestic animals involved.\n#    This might be confusing. Let's simplify:\n#    `SelectiveBreeding(x)` means 'x is a process of selective breeding'.\n#    `DomesticAnimal(y)` means 'y are domestic animals'.\n#    The original premise: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`\n#    This implies `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` is a relation. Let's rename it.\n#    Let's use `InvolvesDomesticAnimals(x, y)` where x is the selective breeding and y are domestic animals.\n#    And `SelectiveBreeding(x)` means 'x is a process of selective breeding'.\n#    Then the premise is: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimal(y) \u2227 InvolvesDomesticAnimals(x, y))`\n#    However, the prompt gives `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`.\n#    This suggests `SelectiveBreeding(x,y)` implies that `x` is a selective breeding and `y` are domestic animals.\n#    This is a good representation. Let's stick to this formulation with corrected predicate names if needed.\n#    The provided initial program has `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`.\n#    This means that if x is a form of Artificial Selection, then there exists a DomesticAnimal(y) such that\n#    SelectiveBreeding(x, y). This implies x is a selective breeding involving y.\n#    Let's adjust the definition of `SelectiveBreeding(x)` slightly.\n#    It's more natural for `SelectiveBreeding(x)` to imply that `x` is the *process* or *act* of selective breeding.\n#    And `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` to mean `x` is a selective breeding *of* `y` (where y are domestic animals).\n#    The prompt says \"SelectiveBreeding(x) ::: x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.\"\n#    This means the predicate itself already encapsulates the involvement of domestic animals.\n#    So, `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is the predicate for the act of selective breeding, which by definition involves domestic animals.\n#    The premise `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` is redundant if `SelectiveBreeding(x)` already implies it.\n#    Let's remove the existential quantification if the definition of `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is sufficient.\n#    However, the prompt implies `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is a general form, and `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` is a more specific relation.\n#    Let's assume `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` means \"x is a selective breeding of y\".\n#    And `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is perhaps a higher-level concept.\n#    Let's stick to the original premise's intent: `SelectiveBreeding(x)` implies that the process `x` involves some domestic animals.\n#    The predicate `DomesticAnimals(y)` is singular in the provided program, but plural in the description. Let's assume it's a type.\n#    Let's assume `DomesticAnimal(y)` is the correct predicate name for a single domestic animal.\n\n# Revised approach based on prompt's constraints: keep same vocabulary, fix bugs, add edges.\n\n# Re-evaluating the premise: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`\n# This premise implies that if something is a SelectiveBreeding (as a concept/process 'x'), then there exists a DomesticAnimal 'y' such that 'SelectiveBreeding(x, y)' holds.\n# This seems to define a relationship where a general SelectiveBreeding process 'x' is linked to specific domestic animals 'y'.\n# The initial predicate `SelectiveBreeding(x) ::: x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.` already implies this.\n# So, the existential quantification might be redundant.\n# Let's consider the possibility that `SelectiveBreeding(x)` refers to the abstract concept, and `SelectiveBreeding(x,y)` refers to a specific instance where `x` is the breeding action and `y` is the set of domestic animals.\n# Given the prompt to simplify logic, if `SelectiveBreeding(x)` already implies it involves domestic animals, the existential premise is not strictly necessary for the logic flow if the definition is robust.\n# However, often in logic encoding, explicit statements of relationships are preferred.\n\n# Let's assume the predicate `DomesticAnimals(y)` should be `DomesticAnimal(y)`.\n# And `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` means \"x is a selective breeding of y\".\n# So if `x` is a `SelectiveBreeding`, then there is *some* `y` that is a `DomesticAnimal` and `x` is a selective breeding of `y`.\n\n# Consider the term \"domestic animals\". It implies a type or set.\n# The predicate `DomesticAnimals(y)` uses 'y' as an individual.\n# If 'y' represents a *set* of domestic animals, the predicate might be `IsDomesticAnimal(y)` for an individual `y`.\n# Or, `DomesticAnimals(S)` where `S` is a set.\n# Assuming `DomesticAnimal(y)` for an individual animal `y`.\n\n# Let's consider the possibility that `DomesticAnimals(y)` means 'y is a *type* of domestic animal'.\n# If so, then `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` could mean 'x is a selective breeding of domestic animals of type y'.\n\n# Let's go with the interpretation that `DomesticAnimal(y)` is for an individual animal.\n# And the original premise is intended to ensure that a 'SelectiveBreeding' instance 'x' must be linked to at least one domestic animal 'y'.\n\n# Simplified premise for SelectiveBreeding:\n# If x is a form of artificial selection, then x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.\n# The original premise: `ArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)`\n# Then: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimal(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreedingOf(x, y))`\n# Let's assume `SelectiveBreeding(x)` directly means \"x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\".\n# This definition is powerful. It implies that `x` is a process that inherently involves domestic animals.\n# Therefore, the existential premise `\u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` might be redundant if `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is defined as such.\n# If `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is defined as \"x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\", then it implies that for any such `x`, there must exist domestic animals that it involves.\n# Let's simplify by removing the redundant existential premise and rely on the definition of `SelectiveBreeding(x)`.\n\n# Updated set of premises:\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",

And we need to ensure that `x` involves domestic animals.\n# The definition of `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is \"x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\".\n# This implies that if `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is true, then `x` involves domestic animals.\n# However, to be more explicit about the type of animal involved, we can infer that if x is a selective breeding, then there exists a y which is a domestic animal, and x is a selective breeding *of* y.\n# Let's consider that the original premise intended to use a predicate `SelectiveBreedingOf(x,y)` meaning \"x is a selective breeding of y\".\n# Given the current predicates, and aiming for simplification and bug fixing:\n# The premise `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimal(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreedingOf(x, y))` from the context was intended to be part of the reasoning.\n# Let's assume `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` means \"x is a selective breeding of y\".\n# And `DomesticAnimal(y)` means \"y is a domestic animal\".\n# The definition of `SelectiveBreeding(x)` already implies it's \"of domestic animals\".\n# To ensure that this \"of domestic animals\" is explicitly represented in the logic, we can connect it to the `DomesticAnimal` predicate.\n# If `SelectiveBreeding(x)` holds, then `x` is a process of selective breeding, and it must have involved some domestic animals.\n# The premise can be rephrased to make this explicit: If x is a form of selective breeding, then x involves some domestic animal.\n# Let's assume the original context's `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` was meant to express this, and `DomesticAnimals` was a typo for `DomesticAnimal`.\n# And let's interpret `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` as a specific relation between the breeding process `x` and a domestic animal `y`.\n# However, the provided program does not have `SelectiveBreedingOf` or `SelectiveBreeding(x,y)`. It only has `SelectiveBreeding(x)`.\n# The prompt says \"Make edits that fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\"\n# The definition `SelectiveBreeding(x) ::: x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.` is self-contained.\n# If `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is true, it *means* it is a selective breeding of domestic animals.\n# Therefore, any explicit existential statement about `y` being a `DomesticAnimal` that `x` is a breeding of, might be redundant if `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is assumed to fully capture this.\n# To simplify and avoid potential redundancy based on the given predicates, we can remove the existential premise if the definition is sufficient.\n# The definition itself implies the existence of domestic animals for any `x` that is `SelectiveBreeding`.\n\n# Re-evaluation of potential missing edge cases and bugs:\n# 1. Domestic Animal Predicate: Added `DomesticAnimal(x)`.\n# 2. Heck Cattle Connection: Explicitly connected Heck Cattle to `BreedingBack` and `ToBreedBack`.\n# 3. Selective Breeding Clarity: Removed potentially redundant existential premise for `SelectiveBreeding(x)` based on its definition, simplifying logic. The definition itself implies the involvement of domestic animals.\n\n# Let's refine the premises to be more explicit about what \"Heck cattle were bred-back\" means in relation to the predicates.\n# `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` implies that `heckCattle` (as an entity or type) was the subject of a breeding back event.\n# The premise `HeckCattle(x) \u2192 BreedingBack(x)` links the type `HeckCattle` to the general concept `BreedingBack`. This is a strong interpretation connecting the definition of Heck Cattle to the process.\n# The premise `HeckCattle(x) \u2192 ToBreedBack(x)` ensures that Heck Cattle fall into the category of animals that are intended for breeding back, aligning with the description \"Heck cattle were bred-back\".\n\n# Final check on the logic flow:\n# BreedingBack -> ArtificialSelection -> SelectiveBreeding.\n# HeckCattle implies BreedingBack. So HeckCattle implies ArtificialSelection and SelectiveBreeding.\n# HeckCattle implies ToBreedBack.\n# `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` provides a specific instance of the past event.\n# `Resemble(heckCattle, aurochs)` links Heck Cattle to Aurochs.\n# `Animal(heckCattle)` and `Animal(aurochs)` are established.\n# The general statement `\u2203x (Animal(x) \u2227 ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))` is also present.\n# Since HeckCattle implies ToBreedBack, and HeckCattle implies Resemble(heckCattle, aurochs), and Aurochs implies Animal and Extinct (implicitly from context, though Extinct(aurochs) is not explicitly stated, the general premise makes it applicable if Aurochs are indeed extinct), this specific case aligns with the general statement. However, the general statement's `Extinct(y)` needs to be considered. The prompt states \"Some animals to be bred-back resemble animals that are extinct.\" This implies that the `y` that is resembled *is* extinct. If Aurochs are considered extinct in this context, then it fits.\n\n# Let's add Extinct(aurochs) to make the connection to the general premise explicit if Aurochs are indeed meant to be extinct in this scenario.\n# The prompt states: \"Some animals to be bred-back resemble animals that are extinct.\"\n# The example given is \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.\"\n# This strongly implies that Aurochs are the extinct animals in this context.\nExtinct(aurochs)\n# Now, the general premise `\u2203x (Animal(x) \u2227 ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))`\n# can be instantiated with `x = heckCattle` and `y = aurochs`.\n# `Animal(heckCattle)` is true. `ToBreedBack(heckCattle)` is true. `Animal(aurochs)` is true. `Extinct(aurochs)` is true. `Resemble(heckCattle, aurochs)` is true.\n# This makes the specific case of Heck Cattle a concrete example of the general rule.\n\n# Reconsidering the `SelectiveBreeding` definition and premise.\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) ::: x is a deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.`\n# This definition inherently means that for any `x` where `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is true, there must exist domestic animals involved in `x`.\n# The original premise in the prompt context was:\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`\n# This was interpreted as needing a predicate `SelectiveBreeding(x,y)` which is not in the current program.\n# To fix bugs and simplify, and given the existing predicates, the most direct interpretation is that the definition of `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is sufficient and implies the involvement of domestic animals without needing an explicit existential premise that refers to a missing relation predicate.\n# Therefore, the simplification is to rely on the definition. No additional premise is strictly needed for `SelectiveBreeding(x)` if the definition is taken as is.\n\n# Final list of premises:\nBreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x)\nArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)\nBredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)\nResemble(heckCattle, aurochs)\nHeckCattle(x) \u2192 Animal(x)\nAurochs(x) \u2192 Animal(x)\nExtinct(aurochs) # Inferred as necessary from the problem description and the general premise.\nHeckCattle(x) \u2192 BreedingBack(x)\nHeckCattle(x) \u2192 ToBreedBack(x)\n\u2203x (Animal(x) \u2227 ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
