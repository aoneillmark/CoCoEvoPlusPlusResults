Consider edge cases:\n# - What if Monkeypox doesn't occur in humans (though the scenario says it does)?

`SymptomOf(symptom_type, disease)`.\n# So, `SymptomOf(Fever, mpox)` is correct.\n\n# Revised approach for the \"glu\" part:\n# The original premise is: \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))\n# This suggests `Glu(x)` is a property of `x` and also the entity that causes tiredness. This is a logical flaw.\n# A more robust representation:\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This can be interpreted as:\n# For every person `p`, if `p` has a condition `g` that is a `Glu`, then `p` feels tired when they have `g`.\n# We'll use `HasCondition(person, condition)` to represent a person having a condition.\n# And `Glu(condition)` to state that the condition is a glu.\n# So the rule is:\n\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 \u2203g (Glu(g) \u2227 HasCondition(p, g)) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))\n\n# If we cannot introduce `HasCondition`, and must use `Glu(x)` directly.\n# And if `Glu(x)` means \"x has a glu\", then the most direct translation using the `FeelingTired` predicate is:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This fixes the bug of passing a predicate to `FeelTiredWhen`.\n\n# However, to keep `FeelTiredWhen` and `Glu`, let's interpret `Glu` as a type of condition, and `FeelTiredWhen(person, condition_type)` as the relation.\n# We still need a way to link a person to that condition type.\n# Let's assume the original intent was that `Glu` itself is the condition.\n# And `FeelTiredWhen(person, Glu)` implies that person has this condition.\n# This requires reinterpreting the predicate `Glu(x)`.\n# If `Glu(x)` means \"x is a glu\", and `FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu)` means \"x feels tired when they have condition Glu\".\n# We still need the link: \"person `x` has condition `Glu`\".\n\n# Let's simplify the symptom representation slightly to remove redundancy in predicates, by assuming the symptom predicates themselves imply they are symptoms.\n# E.g., `Fever(x)` directly states that `x` is a fever, which is a symptom.\n# So, `SymptomOf(Fever, mpox)` implies `Fever` is a symptom of `mpox`.\n\n# Premises:\n# Monkeypox definition and its relation to the virus\nMonkeypox(mpox)\nInfectiousDisease(mpox)\nCausedBy(mpox, mpox_virus)\nMonkeypoxVirus(mpox_virus)\n\n# Occurrence of the virus in animals and humans\nOccurIn(mpox_virus, animals)\nOccurIn(mpox_virus, humans)\n\n# Biological classifications (chaining properties)\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x))\n\u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\n\n# Symptoms of Monkeypox\n# If Fever, Headache, etc. are types of symptoms:\n\u2200d (Monkeypox(d) \u2192 (Fever(d) \u2227 Headache(d) \u2227 MusclePains(d) \u2227 FeelingTired(d)))\n# This assumes that the symptoms are directly observable characteristics of Monkeypox itself, not separate entities.\n# The original `SymptomOf(Fever, x)` implies `Fever` is a type of symptom related to `x`.\n# A simpler approach is to directly state that Monkeypox *has* these symptoms.\n# \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 (Fever(x) \u2228 Headache(x) \u2228 MusclePains(x) \u2228 FeelingTired(x)))\n# This is still not quite right. It means Monkeypox itself IS a fever, headache etc.\n# Correct interpretation: Monkeypox causes or is associated with these symptoms.\n\n# Let's stick to the original `SymptomOf` relation and make it more precise.\n# \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 \u2203s (Symptom(s) \u2227 SymptomOf(s, x)))\n# If Fever, Headache, etc. are types of symptoms:\n\u2200d (Monkeypox(d) \u2192 (SymptomOf(Fever, d) \u2227 SymptomOf(Headache, d) \u2227 SymptomOf(MusclePains, d) \u2227 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, d)))\n# This implies Fever, Headache etc. are predicates representing the symptoms themselves being related to the disease.\n\n# The \"glu\" premise: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# Original: \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))\n# Problem: `Glu(x)` is a predicate, not an entity.\n# Fix using `FeelingTired` predicate directly:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This assumes `Glu(x)` means \"person x has a glu\".\n# If `FeelTiredWhen` must be used and `Glu` is the condition entity:\n# We need `HasCondition(person, condition_entity)`.\n# Let's assume `Glu` itself is the condition entity.\n# And we need `HasCondition(person, Glu)`.\n# We can infer `HasCondition(p, Glu)` if `Person(p)` and `Glu(p)` are true, but this is not good.\n\n# A better formulation for the glu part:\n# Assume `Glu` is a condition type.\n# And `HasCondition(person, condition)` is how we model having a condition.\n# Then: \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasCondition(p, Glu) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu))\n# Since we cannot add predicates, let's stick to the most direct fix using existing ones.\n# If `Glu(x)` means `x` is a person who has a glu.\n# Then: \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This uses the `FeelingTired` predicate for the state of tiredness.\n\n# Let's stick to the original predicates and try to fix the logic of the last premise without adding new ones if possible.\n# The premise: \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))\n# The fundamental issue is `Glu(x)` being used as an argument to `FeelTiredWhen`.\n# The intention is likely that `Glu` represents a condition, and persons having it feel tired.\n\n# If `Glu` is a condition type, and `Person(x)` means `x` is a person:\n# The statement should be: If `x` is a person AND `x` has the condition `Glu`, THEN `x` feels tired.\n# Without `HasCondition`, this is hard.\n\n# Let's assume `Glu(x)` means \"x has a glu\" and we use `FeelingTired(x)` for the outcome.\n# Revised premise:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n\n# If the intent is to keep `FeelTiredWhen`, and `Glu` is a condition:\n# Let's assume `Glu` is a constant entity representing the condition of having a glu.\n# And `HasGlu(person, glu_entity)` relates a person to the condition.\n# Then: \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasGlu(p, Glu) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu))\n# This still requires adding `HasGlu`.\n\n# Let's go with the most direct logical fix of the original faulty premise, assuming `Glu(x)` means \"x is a person who has a glu\".\n# This implies `Person(x)` and `HasAGlu(x)`.\n# Then the premise becomes:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This is a simplification and correction of the logic.\n\n# However, the prompt asks to write a *new* program that is different.\n# This means I should reconstruct the premises from scratch, ensuring correctness and possibly improving on the original formulation of the problem.\n\n# Reconstructing the premises for a new program, ensuring correctness:\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",
