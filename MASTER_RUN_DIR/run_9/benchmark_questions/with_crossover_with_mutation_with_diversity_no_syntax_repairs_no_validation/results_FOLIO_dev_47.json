WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, summer))` from Parent A is redundant if we accept that loving summer the most implies loving summer.\n# The premise `\u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, summer))` from Parent B is also redundant for the same reason.\n# If a separate `Loves(x, summer)` predicate is required and not implied by `FavoriteSeason`, it should be explicitly added.\n# Assuming \"love summer the most\" directly translates to \"favorite season is summer\", the Loves predicate is not strictly necessary for these specific statements to hold.\n# However, if \"Loves\" is a general predicate that can be inferred from \"FavoriteSeason\", we might infer `Loves(james, summer)` from `FavoriteSeason(james, summer)`.\n# But since the explicit rule `\u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, summer))` exists in both parents, and `James` is a student who wants a long vacation, it implies `Loves(james, summer)`.\n# The rule `\u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 FavoriteSeason(x, summer))` is stronger.\n# We keep the stronger rule, as it directly addresses \"love summer the most\".\n# If `Loves(x,y)` is to be a consequence of `FavoriteSeason(x,y)`, a rule like `\u2200x, y (FavoriteSeason(x,y) \u2192 Loves(x,y))` would be needed.\n# Without such a rule, the `Loves` predicate is only covered by the specific statement about students wanting long vacations.\n# Given that \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most\" is present in both parents and implies `FavoriteSeason`, this rule is prioritized.\n# The simpler `Loves(x, summer)` rule is subsumed by the stronger `FavoriteSeason(x, summer)` rule for students wanting long vacations.\n# We will omit the redundant `Loves(x, summer)` rules.\n\n# All seasons are distinct.\n# Using explicit distinctness for clarity.\ndistinct(spring, summer).\ndistinct(spring,
