Explicitly Linking Player to Common Name: The scenario states \"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\" and \"Ailton Silva is a Brazillian footballer who plays for Nautico.\" The provided \"CURRENT PROGRAM\" uses `ailton` in `LoanedTo` and `PlaysFor`, and `ailton_silva` in `Brazilian`. To consistently link the attributes to the commonly known name as per the phrasing, `FootballPlayer(ailton)` is directly asserted.\n# 3. Consistency in Entity References: By using `ailton` for relations where the common name is used in the scenario (loaned to, plays for) and `ailton_silva` for biographical details or where the full name is explicitly mentioned (born in, Brazilian), the premises align more directly with the narrative. The `KnownAs` predicate handles the equivalence.\n# 4. No new information or predicates added, just consolidation and removal of redundancy based on the provided `KnownAs` predicate.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2203x (LoanedTo(AiltonSilva, x) \u2227 FootballClub(x))\n",
