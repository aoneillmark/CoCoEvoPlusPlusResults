The departure and arrival can not be the same airport.\"\n# could be interpreted as a constraint on Susan's flight specifically.\n# However, the given premises are general.\n# Given the phrasing, the most direct interpretation of \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" in the context of predicates like `FliesTo` and `FliesFrom`\n# is that the destination airport of a flight cannot be the same as the departure airport of that same flight.\n# The current `FliesTo(susan, lga)` and `FliesFrom(john, lga)` are specific facts.\n# The constraint \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" seems to apply to the *act* of flying.\n# Let's assume the intent is that for any flight by any person x, the destination airport y cannot be the same as the departure airport z for that person x.\n# This would require a redefinition or new predicates like `DepartureAirportOf(person, airport)` and `ArrivalAirportOf(person, airport)`.\n# With the current predicates, the most sensible interpretation that aligns with \"departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" and existing predicates is that the destination of a flight cannot be a departure airport. This is covered by the added premise above.\n\n# Revisiting the problematic premise: \u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))\n# If SameAirport(a, b) means 'a is the same airport as b', then SameAirport(y, y) is always true.\n# Therefore, \u00acSameAirport(y, y) is always false.\n# This premise means: \u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 False), which implies \u00acFliesTo(x, y) for all x, y.\n# This contradicts FliesTo(susan, lga).\n# Therefore, this premise is fundamentally bugged and must be removed or corrected.\n# The most likely intended meaning of \"departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" is that for a given flight event, the origin and destination are distinct.\n# If we have a predicate `OriginAirport(person, airport)` and `DestinationAirport(person, airport)`, the rule would be:\n# \u2200p ( (DestinationAirport(p, dest) \u2227 OriginAirport(p, orig)) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(dest, orig) )\n# Given the current predicates, the simplest correction that makes sense of the problem statement is to interpret \"departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" as:\n# 1. An airport cannot be both a departure and an arrival airport (captured by \u2200x (Airport(x) \u2192 \u00ac(Departure(x) \u2227 Arrival(x)))).\n# 2. The destination of a flight cannot be the same as its origin.\n# The latter is more complex to encode without introducing new predicates or relating FliesTo and FliesFrom for the *same* person.\n# Let's assume the problem statement means \"an airport that is a departure airport cannot be an arrival airport\".\n# This is already covered by \u2200x (Airport(x) \u2192 \u00ac(Departure(x) \u2227 Arrival(x))).\n\n# The original sentence \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport.\"\n# Given `FliesTo(susan, lga)` and `FliesFrom(john, lga)`, and no explicit link between Susan's departure and John's arrival or vice-versa,\n# the most robust interpretation of this constraint, given the available predicates, is that an airport that serves as a departure point cannot *also* be an arrival point.\n# The premise `\u2200x (Airport(x) \u2192 \u00ac(Departure(x) \u2227 Arrival(x)))` already captures this.\n# The problematic premise `\u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))` is definitely a bug. It should be removed.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the intent of \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport.\"\n# This is a rule about flights.\n# If a flight departs from X and arrives at Y, then X and Y must be different airports.\n# We have `FliesTo(x, y)` and `FliesFrom(x, y)`. We need to associate these for a single flight.\n# The current structure doesn't easily allow us to state \"Person P's flight departs from X and arrives at Y\".\n# However, if we interpret the scenario facts as separate statements:\n# Susan's flight is an arrival at LGA.\n# John's flight is a departure from LGA.\n# The rule \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" could mean that the specific airport mentioned as an arrival cannot be the same as the specific airport mentioned as a departure.\n# But this is too specific. It's more likely a general rule.\n\n# Let's assume the rule means: for any *individual flight*, the origin and destination airports are different.\n# The current predicates don't capture a single \"flight\" event for a person. They only capture \"flies to\" and \"flies from\".\n# If we consider the facts as independent:\n# Susan flies to LGA. (This is an arrival)\n# John flies from LGA. (This is a departure)\n# The rule \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" must apply to any flight.\n# If Susan flies TO an airport, that airport cannot be her DEPARTURE airport.\n# If John flies FROM an airport, that airport cannot be his ARRIVAL airport.\n\n# Given the original faulty premise: `\u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))`\n# This premise is logically inconsistent with `FliesTo(susan, lga)` because `\u00acSameAirport(y, y)` is `False`.\n# This means `\u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 False)`.\n# The intended meaning of \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" is that the destination airport of a flight cannot be the same as the origin airport of that flight.\n# The current predicates do not explicitly link `FliesTo` and `FliesFrom` for a single person's journey.\n# However, the constraint \"departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" is a rule about *airports in relation to flights*.\n# The most direct interpretation that fits the existing predicates without assuming complex re-encoding:\n# An airport cannot be simultaneously an arrival airport and a departure airport.\n# This is already covered by: `\u2200x (Airport(x) \u2192 \u00ac(Departure(x) \u2227 Arrival(x)))`\n\n# The problem states: \"Susan flies to LGA airport.
