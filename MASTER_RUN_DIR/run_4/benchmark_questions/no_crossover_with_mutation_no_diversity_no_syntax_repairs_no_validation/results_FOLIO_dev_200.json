The model doesn't capture the duration\n#   of the loan or who owns the player. This is beyond the scope of the provided predicates.\n# - The scenario mentions \"Ailton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\"\n#   This implies that `ailton_silva` is a specific individual. The current predicates\n#   correctly represent this.\n\n# The current premises seem to accurately capture all the information provided in the scenario\n# and do not appear to have bugs or missing explicit edge cases based on the given predicates.\n# The only 'addition' is acknowledging that the existing premises are sufficient.\n# If a stricter interpretation of \"football player who was loaned out to Braga\" was needed,\n# and if a player could *only* be loaned to a club they *don't* play for, an additional rule\n# could be inferred, but this is not stated.\n\n# Therefore, the most appropriate \"different program\" that satisfies the same problem\n# is simply a clean restatement of the existing, accurate premises.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, x) \u2227 FootballClub(x))\n",
