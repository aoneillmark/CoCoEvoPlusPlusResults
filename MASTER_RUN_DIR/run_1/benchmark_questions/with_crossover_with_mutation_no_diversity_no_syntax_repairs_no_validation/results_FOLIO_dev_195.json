If the intention was that *only one* six-way tie existed, we would need to add a unique existential quantifier (e.g., `!\u2203x ...`). However, the current phrasing in the problem (\"There was one six-way tie on the leaderboard\") usually means \"at least one\" in logic unless uniqueness is explicitly stated. Given the context of a competition, it's likely there's only one such tie being referred to. For simplicity, we'll stick with the existential for now.\n# If there's a possibility of multiple distinct six-way ties, and one of those has a Belgian participant, the statement would still hold.\n# The premise \"Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic\" is captured by `FromBelgium(descampe)` and `OnLeaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic)`.\n# The premise \"All people on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic\" is correctly represented.\n# The core change is merging the redundant existential statements into one that is more specific and uses the consistent predicate `OnLeaderboard`.\n# The original `Leaderboard` predicate seems to be a duplicate of `OnLeaderboard`.\n# Removing `Leaderboard` predicate usage in favor of `OnLeaderboard`.\n# Combined existential premise: `\u2203p (OnLeaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(p) \u2227 FromBelgium(p))`\n# This single premise covers:\n# 1. There was a six-way tie. (`SixWayTie(p)`)\n# 2. Someone was on the leaderboard in that tie. (`OnLeaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic)`)\n# 3. That person was from Belgium. (`FromBelgium(p)`)\n# This is a more concise and accurate representation of the statement \"There was one six-way tie on the leaderboard and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium.\"\n# It also implies that this person from Belgium is on the leaderboard.\n# The original premises:\n# \u2203x (SixWayTie(x) \u2227 Leaderboard(x, 1992duMaurierClassic)).\n# \u2203y (FromBelgium(y) \u2227 Leaderboard(y, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(y)).\n# The second premise is stronger and implies the first one. By stating `\u2203y (FromBelgium(y) \u2227 Leaderboard(y, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(y))`, we already know there is a `Leaderboard` and a `SixWayTie`.\n# By using `OnLeaderboard` consistently, we simplify.\n# The new combined premise:\n# \u2203p (OnLeaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(p) \u2227 FromBelgium(p)).\n# This covers all aspects of the original two existential statements in a single, clearer statement.\n# The premise `FromBelgium(descampe)` and `Leaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic)` are kept but using `OnLeaderboard`.\n# So the corrected premises are:\nWinner(steinhauer, 1992duMaurierClassic).\nParticipated(steinhauer, 1992duMaurierClassic).\n# Combined and simplified premise for the tie:\n\u2203p (OnLeaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(p) \u2227 FromBelgium(p)).\nFromBelgium(descampe).\nOnLeaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic).\n\u2200x (OnLeaderboard(x, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2192 Participated(x, 1992duMaurierClassic)).\n# Removed the redundant `Leaderboard` predicate from the original premises.\n# Replaced `Leaderboard` with `OnLeaderboard` for consistency as `OnLeaderboard` is also provided in the predicates and used for Descampe.\n# The original premise `\u2203x (SixWayTie(x) \u2227 Leaderboard(x, 1992duMaurierClassic))` is implied by the second original existential premise `\u2203y (FromBelgium(y) \u2227 Leaderboard(y, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(y))`.\n# Thus, the second premise alone is sufficient if we also use `OnLeaderboard` consistently.\n# The combined premise `\u2203p (OnLeaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(p) \u2227 FromBelgium(p))` captures the essence more directly.\n# The problem statement \"There was one six-way tie on the leaderboard and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium.\" is fully represented by this single existential statement.\n# This is a simplification by removing redundancy and a bug fix by using a consistent predicate.\n\n# Conclusion:\nSixWayTie(descampe) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(descampe, duMaurierClassic1992)\n",
