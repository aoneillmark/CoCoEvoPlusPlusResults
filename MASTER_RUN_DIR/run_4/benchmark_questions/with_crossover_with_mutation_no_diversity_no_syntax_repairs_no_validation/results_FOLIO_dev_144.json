(Already present)\n# And if it was BredBack, it's a result of a process related to ToBreedBack.\n\n# Clarification on the BredBack predicate:\n# BredBack(x, y) ::: x was bred back in year y.\n# The statement \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s\" refers to the species/type 'Heck cattle' collectively,\n# rather than a single instance.

Specific facts about Heck cattle and Aurochs\n# \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.\"\n# This can be broken down:\n# - The act/process of breeding back of Heck cattle happened in the 1920s.\n# - Heck cattle resemble aurochs.\n# - The resemblance is the goal/outcome of the breeding back.\n\nBredBack(heckCattle_process, year1920s). # Assuming heckCattle_process represents the act of breeding back Heck cattle.\nResemble(heckCattle, aurochs). # This states the type 'Heck Cattle' resembles the type 'Aurochs'.\n\n# 3. Categorization of animals\nHeckCattle(x) \u2192 Animal(x).\nAurochs(x) \u2192 Animal(x).\n\n# 4. The existence of animals to be bred back resembling extinct animals\n# \"Some animals to be bred back resemble animals that are extinct.\"\n\u2203x (Animal(x) \u2227 ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y))).\n\n# Potential Bug/Edge Case Fixes:\n# - The original `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2200y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2192 x is selective breeding of y)` was awkward.\n#   \"x is selective breeding of y\" is not a standard predicate and is ambiguous.\n#   Replaced with `\u2203y DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 IsTheSelectiveBreedingOf(x, y)`.\n#   If `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is true, it implies `x` is the selective breeding of *some* domestic animal.\n\n# - The original `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` treated `heckCattle` and `year1920s` as arguments to `BredBack`.\n#   If `heckCattle` is a type, `BredBack` usually applies to instances or processes.\n#   Clarified by introducing `heckCattle_process` as the subject of `BredBack`.\n#   Also `Resemble(heckCattle, aurochs)` states resemblance between types.\n\n# - Implicitly, if something is 'BreedingBack' or 'BredBack', it likely involves 'DomesticAnimals'.\n#   The prompt doesn't state this explicitly, but it's implied by \"deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\".\n#   We could add:\n#   BreedingBack(x) \u2192 \u2203y DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 InvolvesDomesticAnimals(x, y).\n#   But sticking to the provided vocabulary is key. The existing `SelectiveBreeding` premise handles this.\n\n# Simplified Logic/Edge Cases:\n# - Ensured that the relationship between 'BreedingBack', 'ArtificialSelection', and 'SelectiveBreeding' is chained logically.\n# - Explicitly stated the resemblance between 'Heck Cattle' and 'Aurochs' as a fact about these types.\n# - The existential statement for animals to be bred back is maintained as it is a crucial piece of information.\n\n# Final proposed premises:\nBreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x).\nArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x).\nSelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 IsTheSelectiveBreedingOf(x, y).\nBredBack(heckCattle_process, year1920s).\nResemble(heckCattle, aurochs).\nHeckCattle(x) \u2192 Animal(x).\nAurochs(x) \u2192 Animal(x).\n\u2203x (Animal(x) \u2227 ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y))).\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
