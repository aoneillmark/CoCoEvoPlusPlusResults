The additional FromBelgium(p1) is not generally needed\n# for defining SixWayTie itself, but rather for reasoning about individuals within the tie.\n# The statement \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\" is handled by the existential premise.\n\n# The premise \"\u2200x, y (Leaderboard(x, y) \u2194 OnLeaderboard(x, y))\" is a direct equivalence.\n# We can remove the redundant 'OnLeaderboard' predicate if it's not used elsewhere.\n# For simplicity and adhering to the prompt, we'll keep Leaderboard as the primary predicate.\n# If 'OnLeaderboard' were to be used, this equivalence is correct.\n\n# The original premises contained many repetitive clauses for SixWayTie(p1) through SixWayTie(p6).\n# The existence of the tie implies that any member of that tie is in a six-way tie.\n# The premise that establishes the existence of the tie with exactly 6 members is sufficient.\n# The subsequent premises that make SixWayTie(p1) etc. conditional on all six being on the leaderboard\n# are redundant if we interpret the initial existential statement as defining the tie.\n# We can simplify by asserting that if the condition for the tie is met, all parties involved are in it.\n\n# The prompt implies that there is *exactly one* six-way tie.\n# This is captured by the existential statements that check for exactly 6 members.\n# If the set of people on the leaderboard is exactly 6, then they are in a six-way tie.\n# And all of them are considered to be in that six-way tie.\n\n# Simplified approach: Define the six-way tie condition and then link individuals to it.\n# Let's use a dedicated predicate for the set of people in the tie to be more expressive.\n# However, sticking to the provided predicates, the current approach is to define SixWayTie on individuals.\n\n# The sentence \"There was one six-way tie on the leaderboard\" implies existence of such a tie and uniqueness.\n# The current premises implicitly handle uniqueness by the negation of any other leaderboard members.\n\n# Corrected reasoning for SixWayTie:\n# If a set of exactly 6 people are on the leaderboard for an event, then those 6 people are in a six-way tie.\n\u2200p1, p2, p3,
