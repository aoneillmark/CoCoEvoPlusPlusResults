Let's stick to the structure and infer what's implied.\n# The initial premise `BreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x)` suggests `BreedingBack` is a more specific concept than `ArtificialSelection`.\n# Since `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` is given, and the context states \"Heck cattle were bred-back\", it implies `heckCattle` is an instance of `BreedingBack`.\n# So, we can add:\nBreedingBack(heckCattle)\n# And then the existing premise connects it:\nBreedingBack(heckCattle) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(heckCattle)\n# This implies `heckCattle` is also ArtificialSelection.\n\n# Implicit relationship from the context \"Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.\"\n# This implies a hierarchy: BreedingBack is a type of ArtificialSelection, which is a type of SelectiveBreeding.\n# The original program has this as chained implications. Let's keep them.\n\n# Additional edge case: What if an animal is extinct but not an aurochs?\n# The current premise only states \"Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals\".\n# It doesn't state that *only* extinct animals can be resembled by animals to be bred back.\n# However, the context *specifically* mentions Aurochs being extinct.\n# Let's assume for now that the provided premises are sufficient and don't need to infer more about extinction and resemblance unless explicitly stated.\n\n# Simplification:\n# The statement \"BreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x)\" and \"ArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)\" can be combined for brevity if they always chain.\n# However, keeping them separate might be for clarity or to allow for exceptions in a more complex model.\n# For now, let's keep the original chain as it is given in the problem.\n\n# Adding clarity to the BredBack premise:\n# The premise `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` implies that 'heckCattle' is a specific entity that was bred back.\n# To make it more general if 'heckCattle' is a type:\n# For all x, if x is HeckCattle, then x was bred back in year y implies y is year1920s.\n# However, the phrasing \"Heck cattle were bred-back\" suggests 'heckCattle' is a singular instance representing the breed.\n# Let's assume `heckCattle` and `aurochs` are constants representing the types/breeds.\n\n# Let's refine the premises to be more explicit and fix any potential gaps:\n\n# 1. Defining BreedingBack in relation to the specific instance of Heck Cattle.\n# If something is 'heckCattle', it has been subject to the process of being 'bred back'.\nHeckCattle(heckCattle) # Assuming heckCattle is a constant for the breed/type.\nBredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)\n\n# 2.

Chain of implications for BreedingBack.\nBreedingBack(x) \u2192 ArtificialSelection(x)\nArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)\n# The original premise `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` seems to define SelectiveBreeding as involving domestic animals.\n# We can refine this to be more explicit about what 'y' represents. Let's assume 'y' is the set of domestic animals.\n# Or, more simply, that selective breeding *operates on* domestic animals.\n# Let's rephrase to `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203z (DomesticAnimals(z) \u2227 OperatesOn(x, z))`\n# However, the original program uses `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)`. Let's assume this is a predicate meaning 'x is selective breeding involving y'.\n# This seems to be a typo, and it's more likely that SelectiveBreeding(x) implies x *is* a deliberate selective breeding *of* domestic animals.\n# Let's assume DomesticAnimals(y) where y is the thing being bred.\n# The original `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` is problematic.\n# It seems to imply SelectiveBreeding is a relation with domestic animals.\n# Let's interpret it as: if something is ArtificialSelection, it is a form of SelectiveBreeding, and this SelectiveBreeding *involves* domestic animals.\n# So, for SelectiveBreeding(x), there exists some domestic animal y that is part of this process.\n# Let's make this clearer:\nArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 PurposeOf(x, y)) # x is a form of selective breeding for y.\n# Or, if SelectiveBreeding(x) itself is the action:\n# SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 IsBreedingOf(x, y))\n# The original formulation is `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`.\n# This looks like a typo. Let's assume `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` means `x is a selective breeding of y`.\n# So the premise should be: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 IsSelectiveBreedingOf(x, y))`\n# Given the task is to simplify and fix bugs, and keep vocabulary.\n# Let's assume the original intent was: ArtificialSelection(x) implies x is a SelectiveBreeding *process*, and this process is *applied to* DomesticAnimals.\n# Let's re-introduce `DomesticAnimals(x)` as a type.\nDomesticAnimals(x) ::: x is a domestic animal.\n# And refine the implication.\nArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)\nSelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 Involves(x, y)) # x is a selective breeding process that involves domestic animal y.\n# However, the original has `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)`. This looks like a relation.\n# Let's assume it's `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` means \"x is a selective breeding of y\".\n# Then the premise `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))` means:\n# \"If x is a form of artificial selection, then it is a selective breeding, and there exists a domestic animal y such that x is a selective breeding of y.\"\n# This seems redundant in the predicate name.\n# Let's try to fix the likely typo in the original:\n# Original: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y))`\n# Possible fix: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 IsFor(x, y))` or `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 AppliedTo(x, y))`\n# Given the original had `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)`, and 'x' is the artificial selection, and 'y' is the domestic animal.\n# Let's interpret `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` as \"x is a selective breeding process applied to y\".\n# So the premise becomes:\nSelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 SelectiveBreeding(x, y)) # This means x is a selective breeding process AND there is a domestic animal y that x is applied to.\n\n# Let's consider the context \"Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.\"\n# This implies:\n# 1. BreedingBack is a subset of ArtificialSelection.\n# 2. ArtificialSelection is done by SelectiveBreeding.\n# 3. SelectiveBreeding is of DomesticAnimals.\n\n# Revised Premises:\n# 1.

The original premise was a bit confusing.\n#   We assumed `SelectiveBreeding(x, y)` meant \"x is a selective breeding process applied to y\".\n#   And that `y` must be a domestic animal.\n#   Let's keep this interpretation.\n\n# - The original program did not include a definition for `DomesticAnimals`. It was only used in a premise.\n#   We should add a definition if it's to be used consistently. However, the task says to use the same vocabulary.\n#   Let's assume `DomesticAnimals` is a type that exists.\n\n# --- Simplified Logic ---\n# The chaining of `BreedingBack \u2192 ArtificialSelection \u2192 SelectiveBreeding` is kept as it is a clear definition flow from the context.\n# The key simplification is to make the relationship between specific instances and general concepts explicit.\n\n# Final check of predicates used and not defined.\n# `DomesticAnimals(x)` is used but not defined in the original.\n# Assuming `DomesticAnimals` is a predicate for \"x is a domestic animal\".\n\n# New Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
