Given the original, we interpret\n# \"love summer\" as a general affection.\n\n# Let's refine the implication: If a student wants a long vacation, they love summer.\n# The phrase \"love summer the most\" is tricky. If it implies \"FavoriteSeason(x, summer)\",\n# then the premise should reflect that. However, the direct translation of \"love summer\"\n# is Loves(x, summer). We'll stick to Loves(x, summer) as the most direct interpretation\n# of \"love summer\".\n\n\u2200s (Season(s)). # Explicitly state all seasons are seasons.\n\u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, summer))\n\n# The year has four seasons.\n# This statement is implicitly covered by the definition of seasons.\n# No direct encoding needed if the existence of seasons is established.\n# If \"The year\" is meant as a specific entity, then:\n# Year(y)\n# HasSeason(y, spring)\n# HasSeason(y, summer)\n# HasSeason(y, fall)\n# HasSeason(y, winter)\n# However, the prompt does not introduce a specific \"year\" entity.\n# The initial setup of seasons is sufficient.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(FavoriteSeason(mia, spring) \u2228 FavoriteSeason(mia, fall) \u2228 FavoriteSeason(mia, winter)) \u2227 \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer)\n",
