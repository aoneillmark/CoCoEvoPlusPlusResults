This suggests a conflict or an incomplete specification.\n\n# To resolve this, let's assume the specific statement about Mike is the intended behavior for him.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, the general rule says he needs CPT OR OPT.\n# If the specific statement says he needs CPT, then it must be the case that he indeed needs CPT.\n# This means if he wants to work and has an F1, he needs CPT.\n# The original program's fourth premise is a universal quantification:\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# This premise implies that *any* international student in the US who wants to work\n# needs to apply for CPT, regardless of their visa type. This contradicts the F1 rule\n# which allows for OPT.\n\n# Correction: The fourth premise from the original program is likely meant to be more specific\n# or is a misunderstanding of the overall rules. If the intent is that *all* international\n# students need CPT to work, then the F1 rule (CPT or OPT) is wrong.\n# If the intent is that F1 can do CPT or OPT, and J1 can do CPT, and Mike is subject to\n# one of these, then the premise \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\"\n# is either a specific assertion about Mike that is already covered, or it's an incorrect\n# generalization.\n\n# Revised approach:\n# 1. International students in the US have F1 or J1.\n# 2. F1 students wanting to work need CPT or OPT.\n# 3. J1 students wanting to work need CPT.\n# 4. Mike is an international student in the US.\n\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" needs to be\n# consistent with the visa rules. If Mike has an F1, then he needs CPT or OPT.\n# If the specific statement for Mike is that he needs CPT, then it means Mike *will* apply for CPT\n# if he wants to work. This doesn't preclude him from also being able to apply for OPT,\n# but it asserts that CPT is an option he *needs* to consider.\n\n# Let's assume the original program's intent was to capture the following:\n# - Mike is an international student in the US.\n# - International students in the US have either F1 or J1 (exclusive OR).\n# - If an F1 student wants to work, they can apply for CPT or OPT.\n# - If a J1 student wants to work, they need to apply for CPT.\n# - Mike, specifically, needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work.\n\n# This last point is the tricky one.
