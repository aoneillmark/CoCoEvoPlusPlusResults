This is a slight inaccuracy as \"no more than\" means less than or equal to. However, to keep the original vocabulary, we will stick to `LessThan` as provided. A more precise encoding would use `NotGreaterThan` or a combination of `LessThan` and `EqualTo`.\n# 2000$ is more than $1500.\nMoreThan(2000, 1500).\n\n# Re-encoding the logic with slight improvements for clarity if needed, while adhering to the original vocabulary and intent.\n# The current premises are already quite good and cover the scenario. The main potential improvement or clarification would be around the \"no more than\" logic for the deposit. However, given the constraint to keep the vocabulary, we will assume `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` is intended to mean \"deposit amount is less than 1500\", and therefore not \"no more than 1500\". If we assume the scenario meant \"less than 1500\", then the current encoding is accurate for that. If \"no more than\" implies \"less than or equal to\", then an additional premise or predicate would be needed. For this revision, we will assume `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` is a direct representation of the desired condition in the original prompt.\n\n# Let's check for potential missing edge cases or simplifications:\n# 1. The condition `(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))` implies that the deposit is always at least one month's rent. This is consistent with the scenario.\n# 2. The relationship between `DepositAmount` and the rent amount is implicit. The premise `MoreThan(2000, 1500)` is given separately from the rent. It would be beneficial to link the `DepositAmount` to the `RentAmount` more directly if the problem intended to use that relationship.

For a specific building, rent is usually a fixed amount. This might be meant as a constraint on the specific building Olive Garden, but applied universally. Let's assume it's just establishing a generic property that rent can be 2000 or more, but for Olive Garden it's exactly 2000.\n\n# The lines:\n# \u2200x y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2192 y = 2000)\n# \u2200x y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x) \u2192 MoreThan(y, 2000))\n# These require defining DepositEqualToOneMonthRent and DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent based on RentAmount, which adds complexity. Let's model the relation directly.\n\n# Re-writing premises for clarity and consistency:\n\n# --- Predicates ---\n# (Same as provided in the context)\nAllowedPet(x, y) ::: Pet x is allowed in building y.\nManagedBuilding(x) ::: x is a managed building.\nDepositRequired(x) ::: A deposit is required to rent an apartment in building x.\nRentAmount(x, y) ::: The monthly rent for building x is y.\nDepositAmount(x, y) ::: The security deposit for building x is y.\nCat(x) ::: x is a cat.\nPet(x) ::: x is a pet.\nOwns(x, y) ::: x owns pet y.\nMoveIn(x, y) ::: Person x moves into building y.\nFluffy(x) ::: x is Fluffy.\nTom(x) ::: x is Tom.\nOliveGarden(x) ::: x is the Olive Garden.\nMoreThan(x, y) ::: x is greater than y.\nLessThan(x, y) ::: x is less than y.\n\n# --- Premises ---\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\nFluffy(fluffy)\nTom(tom)\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\n\n# --- Axioms ---\n\n# Type hierarchy and ownership\n\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))\n# This implies Fluffy is a pet because Fluffy(fluffy) and Cat(fluffy) are established.\n# If Fluffy is not a Cat, then we need Cat(fluffy). Let's assume Cat(fluffy) from context.\nCat(fluffy) # Explicitly stating Fluffy is a cat\n\n# Managed buildings and deposits\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 DepositRequired(x))\n# If a deposit is required, there is an amount for it.\n\u2200x (DepositRequired(x) \u2192 \u2203y DepositAmount(x, y))\n# The security deposit for a managed building is either equal to one month's rent or more.\n\u2200x y (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 RentAmount(x, y) \u2192 \u2203deposit_val (DepositAmount(x, deposit_val) \u2227 (deposit_val = y \u2228 deposit_val > y)))\n\n# Pet allowance in managed buildings\n\u2200x y (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 Pet(y) \u2192 AllowedPet(y, x))\n\n# Tom's decision to rent/move in\n# Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building X if and only if:\n# 1. He is allowed to move in with Fluffy (AllowedPet(fluffy, X))\n# 2. The security deposit for X is no more than $1500 (\u2203deposit_val (DepositAmount(X, deposit_val) \u2227 LessThan(deposit_val, 1500)))\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (MoveIn(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u2203deposit_val (DepositAmount(x, deposit_val) \u2227 LessThan(deposit_val, 1500)))))\n\n# Specific numerical relationships (from context)\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\n# This is a direct fact about numbers.\n\n# Deduction about Olive Garden's deposit:\n# Olive Garden is a managed building, so it has a deposit that's >= its rent.\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# Therefore, \u2203deposit_val (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, deposit_val) \u2227 (deposit_val = 2000 \u2228 deposit_val > 2000)).\n# The problem doesn't specify the exact deposit amount beyond this. However, to evaluate Tom's move-in condition, we need a concrete deposit value or a way to query it.\n# The original program had \"DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\" implicitly by stating \"The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000\" and then \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\", which suggests the deposit is likely related to the rent. Let's infer it as 2000 for consistency with the overall problem statement's feel.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) # This satisfies deposit >= rent and also deposit > 1500.\n\n# Based on these premises, let's check Tom's move-in condition for Olive Garden:\n# ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden) is true.\n# AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) is true because ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden) and Pet(fluffy).\n# Is there a deposit_val for Olive Garden such that LessThan(deposit_val, 1500)?\n# We have DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# LessThan(2000, 1500) is false.\n# Therefore, the second part of the condition is false.\n# So, MoveIn(tom, oliveGarden) is false. Tom will not move into Olive Garden.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",
