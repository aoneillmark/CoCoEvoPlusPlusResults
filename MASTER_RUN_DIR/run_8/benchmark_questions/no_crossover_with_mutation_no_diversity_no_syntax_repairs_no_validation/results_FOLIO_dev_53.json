Removed redundant assertions: `Language(french)` and `Language(spanish)` were removed as they can be inferred from `RomanceLanguage` and `BelongsToFamily` rules. `LanguageFamily(romance_family)` and `Related(german, spanish)` were listed twice in the original and one instance was removed.\n# 2. Generalized the language family relation: The original rule `\u2200x \u2200y (BelongsToFamily(x, romance_family) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(y, romance_family) \u2192 Related(x, y))` was specific to `romance_family`. The scenario \"All languages within a language family are related to each other\" implies a more general rule that applies to any language family `z`. The revised rule is `\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (BelongsToFamily(x, z) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(y, z) \u2192 Related(x, y))`. This makes the logic more robust if other language families were introduced.\n# 3. Clarified the rule for Basque not being related to others: Added `\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u00acRelated(x, x))` for completeness, though it's a specific case of the general rule for Basque.\n# 4. Maintained the explicit grounding of specific entities (e.g., `RomanceLanguage(french)`, `BelongsToFamily(french, romance_family)`), as this is common practice for grounding axioms.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acRomanceLanguage(german)\n",

Removed redundant assertions: `Language(french)` and `Language(spanish)` were removed as they can be inferred from `RomanceLanguage` and `BelongsToFamily` rules. `LanguageFamily(romance_family)` and `Related(german, spanish)` were listed twice in the original and one instance was removed.\n# 2. Generalized the language family relation: The original rule `\u2200x \u2200y (BelongsToFamily(x, romance_family) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(y, romance_family) \u2192 Related(x, y))` was specific to `romance_family`. The scenario \"All languages within a language family are related to each other\" implies a more general rule that applies to any language family `z`. The revised rule is `\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (BelongsToFamily(x, z) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(y, z) \u2192 Related(x, y))`. This makes the logic more robust if other language families were introduced.\n# 3. Clarified the rule for Basque not being related to others: Added `\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u00acRelated(x, x))` for completeness, though it's a specific case of the general rule for Basque.\n# 4. Maintained the explicit grounding of specific entities (e.g., `RomanceLanguage(french)`, `BelongsToFamily(french, romance_family)`), as this is common practice for grounding axioms.\n\n# Conclusion:\nRomanceLanguage(french) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(french)\n",
