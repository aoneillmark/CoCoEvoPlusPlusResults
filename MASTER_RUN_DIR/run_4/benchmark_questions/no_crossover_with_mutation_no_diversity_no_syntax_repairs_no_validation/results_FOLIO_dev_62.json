The F1 rule then indicates OPT is also an option he might need to consider *in addition to* or *instead of* if the specific CPT requirement were not so strong.\n# Given the wording, \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is a definitive statement about Mike's requirement for CPT.\n# The prior rule about F1 students is a general rule.\n# If we consider the possibility that the problem intends for the specific rule about Mike to be the primary constraint for him, we can simplify.\n# We are given F1Visa(mike).\n# We are given InternationalStudent(mike) and US(mike).\n# Thus, the general F1 rule implies: Work(mike) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT()))\n# The specific rule for Mike implies: Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# The problem is that the general rule for F1 students allows for OPT as well.\n# The specific rule for Mike only mentions CPT.\n# If the intent is that Mike *must* apply for CPT, then the specific rule is sufficient and simpler.\n# Let's assume the specific rule for Mike is the operative one for him regarding CPT.\n# The presence of F1Visa(mike) is a fact.

The third rule for Mike removes that ambiguity for him.\n# So, the second rule can be simplified if it only applies to *other* students, or if the third rule for Mike is the primary constraint.\n\n# If the intention is to express that F1 students *can* apply for CPT or OPT, and Mike *must* apply for CPT:\n# The most direct way is:\n# Premises:\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nF1Visa(mike)\nWork(mike)\nNeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# General rule for *other* international students with F1 visa in US who want to work.\n# This is to avoid redundancy if the premise for Mike is sufficient.\n# But if we are to maintain general rules:\n# The original second rule implies that if an F1 student wants to work, they need *at least one* of CPT or OPT.\n# The original third rule states Mike *specifically* needs CPT.\n# This means the third rule is a stronger constraint for Mike than the second.\n\n# Simplified program focusing on direct representation and minimal redundancy:\n\n# Premises:\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nF1Visa(mike)\nWork(mike)\n# Directly state Mike's requirement as per the problem description.\nNeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# Rule for general international students in the US (to distinguish visa types).\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n\n# Rule for F1 students in the US who want to work, covering the possibility of OPT if not CPT.\n# This rule is still relevant if we want to express that OPT is also an option for F1 students.\n# However, the prompt asks to simplify logic and fix bugs.

This premise is a specific case of the general rule for F1 visa holders when they want to work. However, it's stated that Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work, which is a direct statement about Mike.\n\nThe current program can be improved by making the statement about Mike more explicit. If Mike is an international student with an F1 visa and wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT. The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is a specific instance of the general rule if we assume Mike has an F1 visa.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the premise about Mike. It states: `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))`. This premise implies that *any* international student in the US who wants to work needs to apply for CPT, regardless of their visa type. This contradicts the earlier premise that F1 visa holders need CPT or OPT.\n\nA better representation would be to acknowledge that Mike is an international student and then apply the general rules. If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he needs CPT or OPT. The premise that he needs CPT is a specific outcome.\n\nHere's an improved version that simplifies by relying on the general rules and the specific statement about Mike:\n\n# Premises:\nInternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Person(mike) ::: Mike is an international student in the US.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))) ::: International students in US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))) ::: An international student in US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.\nWork(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) ::: Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\nF1Visa(mike) ::: Mike has an F1 visa.\n\n# Explanation of Changes:\n1.  **Removed Redundant/Potentially Contradictory General Premise:** The premise `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` was removed because it makes a blanket statement about all international students needing CPT if they work, which is too strong and potentially contradicts the F1 rule.\n2.  **Made Mike's Visa Explicit:** Added `F1Visa(mike)` as a premise. This is necessary to apply the F1-specific rule to Mike and to align with the statement that he needs CPT (which is a specific outcome from the F1 rule).\n3.  **Simplified Mike's Work Rule:** Changed `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` to `Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`. This is a more direct and accurate representation of the scenario information \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" This premise now directly states Mike's requirement without overgeneralizing.\n\nThis revised set of premises correctly models the scenario: Mike is an international student in the US. If he has an F1 visa and wants to work, he needs CPT or OPT. The specific statement that he needs CPT if he wants to work is also captured directly. By adding `F1Visa(mike)`, we can deduce `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT())` from the general F1 rule. And the premise `Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())` directly asserts that if he works, he needs CPT.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
