The latter is syntactically problematic as `Knowledge(y)` is a predicate, not an object. A better interpretation of Parent B's intent combined with Parent A's structure would be:\n# If a person reads a book, they gain *some* knowledge.\n\u2200p \u2200b (Person(p) \u2227 Reads(p, b) \u2192 \u2203k (Knowledge(k) \u2227 Gains(p, k)))\n# This is a simplification but captures the core idea that reading leads to gaining knowledge.\n# Parent A's rule `\u2200p \u2200k (Person(p) \u2227 Gains(p, k) \u2192 Smarter(p))` is more general than Parent B's `\u2200x (Gains(x, Knowledge(harry)) \u2192 Smarter(x))`. We keep the general rule.\n# The rule `\u2200x (Book(x) \u2192 \u2203k (Knowledge(k) \u2227 Contains(x, k)))` from both parents is kept.\n# All instantiated facts are kept.\n\n# Conclusion:\nSmarter(harry)\n",

The latter is syntactically problematic as `Knowledge(y)` is a predicate, not an object. A better interpretation of Parent B's intent combined with Parent A's structure would be:\n# If a person reads a book, they gain *some* knowledge.\n\u2200p \u2200b (Person(p) \u2227 Reads(p, b) \u2192 \u2203k (Knowledge(k) \u2227 Gains(p, k)))\n# This is a simplification but captures the core idea that reading leads to gaining knowledge.\n# Parent A's rule `\u2200p \u2200k (Person(p) \u2227 Gains(p, k) \u2192 Smarter(p))` is more general than Parent B's `\u2200x (Gains(x, Knowledge(harry)) \u2192 Smarter(x))`. We keep the general rule.\n# The rule `\u2200x (Book(x) \u2192 \u2203k (Knowledge(k) \u2227 Contains(x, k)))` from both parents is kept.\n# All instantiated facts are kept.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2200x (Smarter(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Gains(x, y)))\n",
