Parent B's generalized symptom rule is retained.\n\n# The implication that Monkeypox can occur in persons is derived from:\n# 1. The virus occurs in Humans (`OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirusInstance, Humans)`).\n# 2. Humans are Persons (`\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))`).\n# This means that any entity that is a Human is also a Person, and if the virus occurs in Humans, it can occur in Persons.\n# The direct statement `OccurIn(MonkeypoxDisease, Humans)` (disease occurring in humans) can be inferred if we assume\n# that `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirusInstance, Humans)` implies the disease caused by it can occur in humans.\n# However, sticking to the given predicates, `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirusInstance, Humans)` is the most direct statement about where the virus occurs.\n# And the problem implies MonkeypoxDisease can occur where its virus does.\n# The combination of `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirusInstance, Humans)` and `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))` is sufficient to link the disease to persons.\n\n# No further conflicting clauses or significant bugs were found that require more than the reinterpretation of symptom predicates.\n# The combined premises reflect the information from both parents accurately and robustly.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",
