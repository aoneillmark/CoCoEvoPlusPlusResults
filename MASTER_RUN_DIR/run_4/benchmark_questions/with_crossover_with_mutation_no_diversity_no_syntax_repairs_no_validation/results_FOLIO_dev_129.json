This seems to be a specific rule about John's weddings.\n# The original prompt also implies this from \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# This new premise is \"Wedding in July belongs to John.\" This is very strong and potentially contradictory.\n# Let's assume it means: If a wedding is in July, and it belongs to John, then it's a wedding in July (redundant).\n# Or perhaps it means: If a wedding is in July, then it belongs to John. This is too strong.\n# Let's reconsider the original text: \"Wedding in July belongs to John.\"\n# This is a factual statement about *some* weddings.\n# \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# \"Wedding in July belongs to John.\" This could mean that if WeddingInJuly(w) is true, then BelongsTo(w, john) must also be true for that wedding 'w'.\n# However, the current predicates don't allow direct quantification of 'wedding' that is *in* July. WeddingInJuly(w) is a predicate on the wedding itself.\n# Let's re-examine the original \"Wedding in July belongs to John.\"\n# And the earlier \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# If we interpret \"WeddingInJuly(w)\" as a property of the wedding 'w', and \"OccursInJuly(y)\" as a property of an event 'y', and \"Wedding(x, y)\" as person x having wedding y.\n# The current predicates are:\n# WeddingInJuly(x) ::: x is a wedding that occurs in July.\n# OccursInJuly(y) ::: wedding y occurs in July.\n# BelongsTo(x, y) ::: x belongs to y.\n# HasWedding(x, y) ::: x has wedding y.\n# This suggests a distinction between a \"wedding\" object and the event of \"having a wedding.\"\n# The new predicates simplify this: Wedding(w), WeddingInJuly(w).\n# The statement \"Wedding in July belongs to John.\"\n# This implies: If a wedding 'w' is in July, then that wedding 'w' belongs to John.\n# \u2200w (Wedding(w) \u2227 WeddingInJuly(w) \u2192 BelongsTo(w, john))\n# This implies that all July weddings belong to John.\n# This clashes with \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# If WeddingInJuly(w), then BelongsTo(w, john).\n# If WeddingInJuly(w), then \u2203p (Person(p) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 TravelsToParis(p)).\n# If we combine these, it means if WeddingInJuly(w), then BelongsTo(w, john) AND there exists someone (who must be John) who travels to Paris.\n# Let's use the interpretation that WeddingInJuly(w) means wedding w is in July.\n# The premise \"Wedding in July belongs to John\" implies: For any wedding 'w', if 'w' is in July, then 'w' belongs to John.\n\u2200w (Wedding(w) \u2227 WeddingInJuly(w) \u2192 BelongsTo(w, john))\n\n# Redundant/Confusing Premise from original:\n# \"BelongsTo(wedding, john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(wedding) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(wedding)\"\n# This is redundant if WeddingInJuly(x) directly means x is a wedding in July.\n# And \"OccursInJuly(y)\" is also a predicate on the wedding.\n# Let's remove this as it's either redundant or unclear how it interacts with the new predicate definitions.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac(\u2203w (Wedding(w) \u2227 WellAttended(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, john))) \u2227 \u00acTravelsToParis(john)\n",
