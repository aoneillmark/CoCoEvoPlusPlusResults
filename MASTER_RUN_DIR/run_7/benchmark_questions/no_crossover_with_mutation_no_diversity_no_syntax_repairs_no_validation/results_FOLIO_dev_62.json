The third rule `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` is too broad if we consider the first rule's conditions. If the student has a J1 visa, they may also need to apply for something to work, but the prompt only specifies F1 for CPT/OPT.\n# Let's refine the rules to be more precise and avoid overgeneralization or redundancy based on the scenario.\n\n# Corrected Premises:\nPerson(mike)\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nF1Visa(mike)\nWork(mike)\n\n# All international students in the US have either an F1 or J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n\n# An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if they want to work.\n# The prompt specifically mentions CPT for Mike, and the scenario links F1 to CPT or OPT.\n# We will keep the F1 -> CPT/OPT link for working students.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# Mike is an international student and needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work.\n# This is already covered by the general rule above, given Mike's properties.\n# However, to ensure this specific fact is encoded, we can make it more explicit or rely on the general rule.\n# The initial set had a redundant rule. Let's keep the rule that directly applies to F1 visa holders wanting to work.\n# The scenario states \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work.\" This is a specific instance.\n\n# If Mike wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT.\n# This is derived from the general rule, but let's keep it to be explicit and also to follow the prompt's wording.\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) # This is too general, only F1 students need CPT/OPT.\n# Based on the prompt: \"Mike is an international student.

The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is a rule about Mike.\n# Let's represent this rule about Mike explicitly.\n\n# Revised and Simplified Premises:\nPerson(mike)\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nF1Visa(mike)\nWork(mike)\n\n# Any international student in the US must have an F1 or J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n\n# An international student in the US with an F1 visa who wants to work needs to apply for CPT.\n# This rule is more specific than the original third rule, and directly addresses the F1 case for CPT.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work. (This is a specific rule about Mike, which is consistent with the general rule for F1 visa holders.)\n# This specific rule can be stated, and it reinforces the general rule's application to Mike.\n# It's already implied if he has an F1 visa and wants to work, so it can be seen as redundant if we trust the general rule.\n# However, to ensure the \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is explicitly a premise:\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2227 (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) # This is very close to the previous one.\n\n# The prompt is a bit ambiguous if \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is a statement of fact or a rule.\n# Assuming it's a rule that applies specifically to Mike, and is more specific than general rules:\n# Let's make the rules as concise and precise as possible based on the description.\n\n# Final Decision on Premises:\nPerson(mike)\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nF1Visa(mike)\nWork(mike)\n\n# International students in US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n\n# An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.\n# The prompt specifically mentions CPT for Mike, so we will focus on that.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n# This is a specific instance of the above rule, given Mike's properties.\n# This line can be directly encoded as a rule about Mike.\n# If we want to preserve the \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" as a premise that is not strictly derived from the F1Visa rule:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) # This is too broad and would make the F1Visa rule redundant.\n\n# Let's follow the prompt's structure and keep the rules general where applicable and specific for Mike if implied.\n# The original set had a redundant rule. The third rule was redundant given the second.\n# The scenario provides specific facts about Mike.\n# The rules should be generalized statements derived from the scenario.\n\n# Revised Program:\nPerson(mike)\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nF1Visa(mike)\nWork(mike)\n\n# Rule 1: International students in the US have either an F1 or J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n\n# Rule 2: An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if they want to work.\n# The scenario implies that for working, CPT/OPT is necessary for F1 students.\n# We will use CPT as it is explicitly mentioned for Mike.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# Rule 3: Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work.\n# This specific rule about Mike is already captured by Rule 2, given that Mike is an international student in the US with an F1 visa and wants to work.\n# However, to make it a premise as described in the scenario:\n# If the intention is that this is a direct premise about Mike's needs, and not necessarily derived from his visa status:\n# Let's represent it as a specific implication for Mike.\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2227 InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) # This is still very similar to Rule 2.\n\n# Simplification: The core logic is that F1 students wanting to work need CPT.

The general rule implies *only* CPT.\n\n# The most accurate representation sticking to the exact wording is:\n# - General rule for F1: F1 + Work => CPT or OPT.\n# - Specific rule for Mike: Work => CPT.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the original program's rules again in light of the wording.\n# The scenario states: \"Mike is an international student. Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\"\n# This is a direct statement about Mike.\n# It's not presented as a generalization for all international students.\n\n# So, the original program's rule 4:\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# is indeed an overreach. It assumes the specific rule about Mike applies to *all* international students.\n\n# The revised program should remove this rule and keep the specific rule for Mike.\n# The specific rule for Mike is: if he wants to work, he needs CPT.\n# This can be represented as: Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# The original program's rule 3:\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())))\n# This is correct and directly from the scenario.\n\n# So the new program should include:\n# - Facts about Mike.\n# - General rule about Intl students having F1/J1.\n# - General rule about F1 students needing CPT/OPT for work.\n# - Specific rule about Mike needing CPT for work.\n\n# The logic appears sound now.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
