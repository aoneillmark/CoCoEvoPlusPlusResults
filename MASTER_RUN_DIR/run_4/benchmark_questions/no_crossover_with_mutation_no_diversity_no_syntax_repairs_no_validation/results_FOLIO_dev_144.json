The existing premises cover this.\n\n# Simplifying the SelectiveBreeding premise:\n# The original \"\u2200y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2192 x is selective breeding of y)\" is ambiguous as \"x is selective breeding of y\" is not a defined predicate.\n# Assuming it means \"x is a selective breeding *process* involving domestic animals\", we can rephrase.\n# A more robust interpretation:\nSelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 Involves(x, y)\n# However, if we stick to the original vocabulary, the premise might be intended to imply\n# that any act of SelectiveBreeding is *of* domestic animals.\n# If the intention is that BreedingBack *uses* domestic animals, we might need a new predicate or a different formulation.\n# Given the lack of a predicate for \"is selective breeding of y\", we'll assume SelectiveBreeding(x) itself\n# implies it pertains to domestic animals if it's a form of BreedingBack.\n# For simplicity and adherence to existing predicates, we can remove the ambiguous part if it's not crucial for the provided premises.\n# If the scenario implies that SelectiveBreeding *itself* implies the involvement of domestic animals,\n# then the premise `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2200y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2192 x is selective breeding of y)`\n# is problematic. Let's assume that if something is ArtificialSelection, it inherently involves domestic animals for breeding purposes.\n\n# Revised premises to be more precise and avoid ambiguity:\nArtificialSelection(x) \u2192 SelectiveBreeding(x)\nSelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 DomesticAnimalsUsedIn(x) # Introducing a conceptual predicate for clarity, or assuming it's implied.\n# If we must avoid new predicates, let's interpret the original premise in a way that is parsable:\n# \"SelectiveBreeding(x) is a process that applies to domestic animals.\"\n# This could be interpreted as: For any x that is SelectiveBreeding, it must be applied to some DomesticAnimal.\n# This would require a predicate like AppliesTo(x, y) or Involves(x, y).\n\n# Let's go with a simpler, yet consistent interpretation of the original premises provided, fixing the ambiguous part:\n# Original: SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2200y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2192 x is selective breeding of y)\n# This structure is hard to parse directly.
