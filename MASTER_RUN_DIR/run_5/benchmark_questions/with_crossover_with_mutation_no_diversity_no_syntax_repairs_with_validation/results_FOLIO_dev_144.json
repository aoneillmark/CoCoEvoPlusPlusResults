The intended meaning is likely that x is a selective breeding of *some* domestic animal.\n# The introduction of `IsSelectiveBreedingOf` and `\u2203y` clarifies this.\n# If the constraint is to keep *exactly* the same vocabulary, then the original premise needs careful interpretation.\n# Let's revert to a structure that is closer to the original if new predicates are not strictly allowed.\n\n# Sticking to original predicate definitions and premises, with minimal logical fixes.\n# The original `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2200y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2192 x is selective breeding of y)` is still problematic.\n# If we must use the predicates as defined, the most charitable interpretation of the original intent for that premise is that selective breeding inherently involves domestic animals.\n# Without introducing `IsSelectiveBreedingOf`, we can't express \"selective breeding *of* y\".\n# Given the constraint to not introduce new predicates unless fixing bugs or edge-cases, let's re-evaluate the original premise as is.\n# The premise can be interpreted as: \"If x is selective breeding, then for any y, if y is a domestic animal, then x is a selective breeding (of something implied).\" This is weak.\n\n# A better way to express the same idea without new predicates, if \"x is selective breeding of y\" is implicitly understood:\n# SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 RelatedToSelectiveBreeding(x,y) where RelatedToSelectiveBreeding is an implied relation.\n# Since we must stick to the defined predicates:\n\n# Re-writing the premises to be as close as possible to the original, with fixes if found.\n# The original premise: `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2200y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2192 x is selective breeding of y)` is logically problematic.\n# It asserts that if x is selective breeding, then for ALL domestic animals y, x is a selective breeding of y. This implies x is a selective breeding of every domestic animal simultaneously.\n# This is likely not the intent. The intent is probably: \"Selective breeding is the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.\"\n\n# Let's assume `SelectiveBreeding(x)` refers to the *act* or *process* of selective breeding.\n# The most accurate representation of \"deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\" would be that the act of selective breeding is performed on domestic animals.\n\n# If we *must* use `SelectiveBreeding(x)` and `DomesticAnimals(y)` and cannot introduce a new predicate relating them, we can state:\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y DomesticAnimals(y)` (if x is selective breeding, then there exists some domestic animal). This is weak but uses only given predicates.\n# Or, we can infer a property of the process itself:\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 IsOfType(x, SelectiveBreedingOfDomesticAnimals)` - but this requires a new predicate.\n\n# Given the instruction \"Make edits that fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\"\n# The bug is in the existential quantification in `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2200y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2192 x is selective breeding of y)`.\n# It should be `\u2203y` not `\u2200y`.\n\n# Corrected premise:\n# SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DomesticAnimals(y) \u2227 IsSelectiveBreedingOf(x, y)) -- This requires a new predicate.\n# If we cannot introduce new predicates:\n# Let's represent the idea that selective breeding *involves* domestic animals.\n# If `SelectiveBreeding(x)` is a process:\n# `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u00ac\u2200y \u00acDomesticAnimals(y)` which is `SelectiveBreeding(x) \u2192 \u2203y DomesticAnimals(y)`.\n# This states that if a process is selective breeding, then there exists at least one domestic animal. This is a minimal fix.\n\n# Final set of premises, applying minimal fix to the existential quantification issue and maintaining original vocabulary.\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
