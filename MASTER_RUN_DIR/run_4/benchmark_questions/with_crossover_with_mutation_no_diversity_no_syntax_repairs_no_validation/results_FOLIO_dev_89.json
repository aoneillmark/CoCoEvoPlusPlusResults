The implicit link is that K_gained is a consequence of reading Walden, and therefore K_gained is related to K_w.\n# 6. If Harry Gains K_gained, and K_gained is Knowledge, then Harry becomes Smarter.\n# The initial premises seem to be sufficient for this deduction.\n# Let's focus on potential edge cases or simplifications.\n# The second premise `\u2200x \u2200y (Person(x) \u2227 Reads(x, y) \u2192 Gains(x, y))` is too broad. `y` could be anything.\n# It should be `\u2200x \u2200y (Person(x) \u2227 Reads(x, y) \u2227 Book(y) \u2192 Gains(x, y))`. This is addressed in the current version.\n# The third premise `\u2200x \u2200y (Gains(x, y) \u2192 Smarter(x))` is also too broad. `y` could be anything.\n# It should be `\u2200x \u2200y (Person(x) \u2227 Gains(x, y) \u2227 Knowledge(y) \u2192 Smarter(x))`. This is addressed in the current version.\n# The phrasing \"tons of knowledge\" suggests `\u2203y`. If it was `\u2200y`, that would be very different.\n# The current premises are:\n# P1: Book(x) -> Exists y (Knowledge(y) and Contains(x,y))\n# P2: Person(x) and Reads(x,y) and Book(y) -> Gains(x,y)\n# P3: Person(x) and Gains(x,y) and Knowledge(y) -> Smarter(x)\n# Facts: Person(harry), Book(walden), Reads(harry, walden)\n# Deduction:\n# From P1 and Book(walden), we get Exists y (Knowledge(y) and Contains(walden,y)). Let this y be k_w. So, Knowledge(k_w) and Contains(walden, k_w).\n# From P2 and Person(harry), Reads(harry, walden), Book(walden), we get Gains(harry, walden). Wait, Gains(x,y) implies x gains y, so Gains(harry, walden) is not correct. It should be Gains(harry, k_w).\n# The premise `Reads(x, y)` means x reads y. The premise `Gains(x, y)` means x gains y.\n# The original phrasing: \"When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.\"\n# If x reads y, and y is a book, then x gains *some knowledge*.\n# The `Gains(x,y)` predicate implies that `y` is what is gained.\n# So if Harry reads Walden, Harry gains something. What does Harry gain?\n# The original premise says \"that person gains knowledge\". So Harry gains knowledge.\n# The current premises are:\n# Book(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Knowledge(y) \u2227 Contains(x, y))\n# Person(x) \u2227 Reads(x, y) \u2227 Book(y) \u2192 Gains(x, y)\n# Person(x) \u2227 Gains(x, y) \u2227 Knowledge(y) \u2192 Smarter(x)\n# Person(harry) \u2227 Book(walden) \u2227 Reads(harry, walden)\n# Let's re-evaluate the `Gains` predicate. If Harry reads Walden, does he gain Walden itself? Or does he gain knowledge *from* Walden?\n# The phrasing \"that person gains knowledge\" implies the latter.\n# The original version might be implying `Gains(harry, knowledge_from_walden)`.\n# The current predicate `Gains(x, y)` means x gains y.\n# So, `Gains(harry, walden)` would mean Harry gained Walden. This is not right.\n# The `Gains` predicate should probably have a specific knowledge object as its second argument.\n# Let's introduce a new predicate `Knowledge_from(k, b)` meaning knowledge `k` is from book `b`.\n# And `Gains(p, k)` means person `p` gains knowledge `k`.\n\n# Revised Predicates and Premises:\n# Book(x) ::: x is a book.\n# Knowledge(x) ::: x is knowledge.\n# Contains(x, y) ::: x contains y.\n# Person(x) ::: x is a person.\n# Reads(x, y) ::: x reads y.\n# Gains(x, y) ::: x gains knowledge y. (Changed meaning: y must be Knowledge)\n# Smarter(x) ::: x becomes smarter.\n# Author(x, y) ::: x is the author of y.\n# Title(x, y) ::: x has the title y.\n# Knowledge_from(k, b) ::: knowledge k is from book b.\n\n# Premises:\n# Books contain tons of knowledge.\n# This implies that for any book, there exists knowledge that originates from it.\n\u2200x (Book(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Knowledge(y) \u2227 Knowledge_from(y, x)))\n# When a person reads a book, that person gains the knowledge from that book.\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200k (Person(x) \u2227 Book(y) \u2227 Reads(x, y) \u2227 Knowledge_from(k, y) \u2192 Gains(x, k))\n# If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\n\u2200x \u2200k (Person(x) \u2227 Gains(x, k) \u2227 Knowledge(k) \u2192 Smarter(x))\n# Harry read the book \u201cWalden\u201d by Henry Thoreau.\nPerson(harry)\nBook(walden)\nTitle(walden, \"Walden\")\nAuthor(henrythoreau, walden)\nReads(harry, walden)\n# Walden contains knowledge. We don't need a specific `Contains` predicate for this new structure.\n# We need to assert that *some* knowledge comes from Walden.\n\u2203k_w (Knowledge(k_w) \u2227 Knowledge_from(k_w, walden))\n\n# This formulation directly links reading a book to gaining specific knowledge *from* that book, and then to becoming smarter.\n# The `Knowledge_from` predicate captures the idea that books are sources of knowledge.\n# The `Contains` predicate from the original problem is implicitly handled by `Knowledge_from`.\n# The issue with the original was that `Gains(x, y)` was too general. `y` could be the book itself, or something else.\n# By making `Gains(x, k)` explicitly mean `x` gains knowledge `k`, and ensuring `k` is indeed Knowledge, we fix this.\n# The edge case of what exactly is gained is addressed.\n# The edge case of what kind of `y` makes one smarter is addressed.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2200x (Smarter(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Gains(x, y)))\n",
