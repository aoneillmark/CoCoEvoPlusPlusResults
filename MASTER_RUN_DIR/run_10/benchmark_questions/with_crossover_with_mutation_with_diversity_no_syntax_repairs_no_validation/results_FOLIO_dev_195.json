Therefore, this premise is not directly needed\n# to encode the given information about the number of people and the tie. If SixWayTie(x)\n# was meant to be a predicate that applies to *a person* who is *in* a six-way tie,\n# the encoding would need to be structured differently, possibly with a new predicate\n# like `IsInSixWayTie(person, event)`. However, as `SixWayTie(x)` is defined as\n# \"x is on the leaderboard in a six-way tie\", and the scenario directly implies\n# the existence of such a tie with 6 people, the existing logic of ensuring exactly 6\n# people on the leaderboard implicitly covers this.\n# For instance, if we wanted to say `SixWayTie(leaderboard_state)` where `leaderboard_state`\n# represents the entire leaderboard, that would be a different encoding. Given the current\n# predicate `SixWayTie(x)` where `x` seems to refer to a person, and the scenario\n# implies there's *a* six-way tie, the most direct interpretation is that the event\n# itself had a six-way tie, which results in exactly 6 people on the leaderboard.\n# Thus, we will not add a premise for `SixWayTie(x)` as its meaning and usage are ambiguous\n# in the context of the existing predicates and scenario interpretation.\n# If the intention was to state that *exactly one* person from Belgium was in that tie,\n# we would add `\u2203p. (OnLeaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 FromBelgium(p) \u2227 (\u2200q. (OnLeaderboard(q, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 FromBelgium(q) \u2192 q = p)))`.\n# However, the phrasing \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\" can also mean\n# \"at least one person...\" as currently encoded.\n# The presence of `OnLeaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic)` and `FromBelgium(descampe)`\n# already fulfills the condition of at least one person from Belgium being on the leaderboard.\n# The scenario does not explicitly state that *only* one person was from Belgium, nor that\n# the six-way tie consisted of exactly 6 people *and* one of them was from Belgium.\n# It says \"one six-way tie on the leaderboard\" and \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\".\n# This can be interpreted as: the event had a six-way tie structure on its leaderboard, and within that tie, at least one person was from Belgium.\n# The current encoding of \"exactly 6 people\" and \"at least one from Belgium\" covers this.\n# The current premise `OnLeaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 FromBelgium(descampe)` ensures that Descampes is one of those people on the leaderboard and is from Belgium.\n# If the scenario meant that there was *another* six-way tie where *only* one person was from Belgium, and Descampes was *not* part of that tie, that would be a different problem.\n# Assuming the existing interpretation is correct, the logic is sound.\n# No change is strictly necessary for SixWayTie(x) based on the provided scenario interpretation.\n\n# Conclusion:\nSixWayTie(descampe) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(descampe, duMaurierClassic1992)\n",
