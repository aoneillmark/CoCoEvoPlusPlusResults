It's now clarified using 'SixWayTieOf(x, y)' to indicate a specific person's membership in a tie for a specific event. The concept of a tie group is now represented by the existential quantification over a set of people bound by the 'SixWayTieOf' predicate and its size. The premise '\u2203person_in_tie(FromBelgium(person_in_tie) \u2227 Leaderboard(person_in_tie, duMaurierClassic1992) \u2227 SixWayTieOf(person_in_tie, duMaurierClassic1992))' is now handled by a more explicit existential statement that ensures *one person in the six-way tie* is from Belgium. The premise '\u2200x, y (Leaderboard(x, y) \u2227 SixWayTie(x) \u2192 \u2203z (Leaderboard(z, y) \u2227 SixWayTie(z) \u2227 z \u2260 x)))' has been updated to reflect the 'SixWayTieOf' predicate. The added premise '\u2200x, y (SixWayTieOf(x, y) \u2192 \u2203z (Leaderboard(z, y) \u2227 SixWayTieOf(z, y)))' ensures that if someone is in a six-way tie, there are indeed other people in that tie for that event. The final premise explicitly states that for any group identified as a six-way tie, there must be at least one person from Belgium within that tie.\n\n# Conclusion:\nSixWayTie(descampe) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(descampe, duMaurierClassic1992)\n",

The premise '\u2203person(FromBelgium(person) \u2227 Leaderboard(person, duMaurierClassic1992) \u2227 SixWayTieOf(person, duMaurierClassic1992))' is redundant given the other premises, but kept for consistency if it implies an *additional* constraint beyond a general six-way tie. However, a more precise representation is to say *one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium*. The original premise was interpreted as \"there exists a person who is from Belgium, on the leaderboard, and is part of a six-way tie\".
