Explicitly stating `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` aligns with `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and the deposit requirement for managed buildings.\n# - Fluffy is Tom's cat, cats are pets: `Owns(tom, fluffy)`, `Cat(fluffy)`, `\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))` correctly establish Fluffy as a pet owned by Tom.\n# - Tom's renting condition: `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (MoveIn(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500))))` is the core.\n# - Numerical comparisons: `MoreThan(2000, 1500)` is crucial.\n\n# The original prompt included `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)`. If we keep this, and given `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and `MoreThan(2000, 1500)`, then `\u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden), 1500)` is false.\n# So, `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden), 1500)` would be `true \u2227 false`, which is `false`.\n# This implies `MoveIn(tom, oliveGarden)` is false. This is a valid conclusion and doesn't introduce a bug.\n\n# Let's consider the wording again: \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\" This implies there exists a managed building where pets are allowed. It does not imply pets are allowed in *all* managed buildings, or specifically in Olive Garden.\n# The premise `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)` was an explicit assertion of this.\n# If the intention was to deduce Tom's actions, then the deposit condition is the deciding factor for Olive Garden.\n\n# Final check of premises for consistency and completeness relative to the scenario description.\n# The scenario states \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# This means if a deposit is required, and rent is R, then deposit D satisfies D=R or D>R.\n# This is captured by `\u2200x (DepositRequired(x) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)))`.\n# Combined with `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and `DepositRequired(oliveGarden)`, it implies `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, D)` where `D >= 2000`.\n# Explicitly stating `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` is one valid instantiation of this.\n# The original program had `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)`. We will keep this premise as it's directly from the scenario's explicit statements about Fluffy and Olive Garden, and it's consistent with the fact that pets *can* be allowed in managed buildings.\n\n# Revised Premises:\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nDepositRequired(oliveGarden)\n# A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.\n\u2200x (DepositRequired(x) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)))\n# The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nCat(fluffy)\n\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# For Olive Garden, since DepositRequired is true and RentAmount is 2000,\n# and deposit is >= one month's rent, the deposit must be at least 2000.\n# We explicitly state a deposit amount that meets this condition.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (MoveIn(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500))))\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\n# Explicitly stated in the scenario: \"AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)\" is a premise.\nAllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)\n# Note: With AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) being true, and MoreThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden), 1500) being true (since 2000 > 1500),\n# the condition (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500)) for Olive Garden becomes (true \u2227 false), which is false.\n# This correctly leads to \u00acMoveIn(tom, oliveGarden).\n# The original set of premises was logically consistent, but perhaps the goal is to rephrase or reorder.\n# The original set of premises implies that Tom will NOT move into the Olive Garden, which is a correct inference based on the problem statement.\n# The prompt asked to make edits that fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\n# The original logic appears sound.

Explicitly stating `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` aligns with `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and the deposit requirement for managed buildings.\n# - Fluffy is Tom's cat, cats are pets: `Owns(tom, fluffy)`, `Cat(fluffy)`, `\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))` correctly establish Fluffy as a pet owned by Tom.\n# - Tom's renting condition: `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (MoveIn(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500))))` is the core.\n# - Numerical comparisons: `MoreThan(2000, 1500)` is crucial.\n\n# The original prompt included `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)`. If we keep this, and given `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and `MoreThan(2000, 1500)`, then `\u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden), 1500)` is false.\n# So, `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden), 1500)` would be `true \u2227 false`, which is `false`.\n# This implies `MoveIn(tom, oliveGarden)` is false. This is a valid conclusion and doesn't introduce a bug.\n\n# Let's consider the wording again: \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\" This implies there exists a managed building where pets are allowed. It does not imply pets are allowed in *all* managed buildings, or specifically in Olive Garden.\n# The premise `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)` was an explicit assertion of this.\n# If the intention was to deduce Tom's actions, then the deposit condition is the deciding factor for Olive Garden.\n\n# Final check of premises for consistency and completeness relative to the scenario description.\n# The scenario states \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# This means if a deposit is required, and rent is R, then deposit D satisfies D=R or D>R.\n# This is captured by `\u2200x (DepositRequired(x) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)))`.\n# Combined with `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and `DepositRequired(oliveGarden)`, it implies `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, D)` where `D >= 2000`.\n# Explicitly stating `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` is one valid instantiation of this.\n# The original program had `AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)`. We will keep this premise as it's directly from the scenario's explicit statements about Fluffy and Olive Garden, and it's consistent with the fact that pets *can* be allowed in managed buildings.\n\n# Revised Premises:\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nDepositRequired(oliveGarden)\n# A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.\n\u2200x (DepositRequired(x) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)))\n# The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nCat(fluffy)\n\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# For Olive Garden, since DepositRequired is true and RentAmount is 2000,\n# and deposit is >= one month's rent, the deposit must be at least 2000.\n# We explicitly state a deposit amount that meets this condition.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (MoveIn(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500))))\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\n# Explicitly stated in the scenario: \"AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)\" is a premise.\nAllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)\n# Note: With AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) being true, and MoreThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden), 1500) being true (since 2000 > 1500),\n# the condition (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500)) for Olive Garden becomes (true \u2227 false), which is false.\n# This correctly leads to \u00acMoveIn(tom, oliveGarden).\n# The original set of premises was logically consistent, but perhaps the goal is to rephrase or reorder.\n# The original set of premises implies that Tom will NOT move into the Olive Garden, which is a correct inference based on the problem statement.\n# The prompt asked to make edits that fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\n# The original logic appears sound.

It retains the core logic and addresses the scenario correctly. The redundant deposit type predicates from the original program are not strictly necessary if we rely on the direct rule and numerical values. However, to keep the vocabulary similar, one could reintroduce them, but the prompt asks for simplification as well.

The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n\n# For Olive Garden:\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# DepositRequired(oliveGarden)\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, D_OG)  where D_OG >= 2000 (because it must be >= one month's rent)\n\n# Now consider Tom's conditions for renting:\n# AllowedPet(fluffy, b) AND DepositAmount(b, D) <= 1500\n\n# For Olive Garden, we have D_OG >= 2000.\n# Since 2000 is more than 1500, any deposit D_OG that is >= 2000 will also be > 1500.\n# Therefore, the condition DepositAmount(oliveGarden, D_OG) <= 1500 cannot be satisfied if D_OG >= 2000.\n\n# We need to add a premise that explicitly states the deposit amount for Olive Garden.\n# The problem states \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# It doesn't give a *specific* deposit amount for Olive Garden, only the rent.\n# However, the implication is that the deposit for Olive Garden is at least its rent.\n\n# Let's introduce an explicit premise for the deposit amount of Olive Garden to resolve ambiguity.\n# Assuming the deposit for Olive Garden is at least its rent, and can be more.\n# If we assume the deposit for Olive Garden is exactly one month's rent for simplicity, or some specific value.\n# The statement \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\" applies to *managed buildings in general*.\n# It doesn't mean *every* managed building's deposit is *exactly* one month's rent or more. It means *if* a deposit is specified, it fits this rule.\n\n# The most direct interpretation of \"The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000\" and \"A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building. The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\"\n# leads to: DepositAmount(oliveGarden, D) where D >= 2000.\n\n# Let's make a concrete assumption for the deposit amount of Olive Garden, consistent with the rules.\n# For example, assume the deposit for Olive Garden is exactly $2000.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n\n# This implies DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) because RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# And it also means \u00acDepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) if we interpret \"more than\" strictly.\n\n# Now, let's apply Tom's rental condition to Olive Garden.\n# Tom rents in a managed building 'b' IF AND ONLY IF:\n# 1. AllowedPet(fluffy, b)\n# 2. DepositAmount(b, D) <= 1500\n\n# For Olive Garden:\n# ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden) is true.\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is now a premise.\n# We know MoreThan(2000, 1500).\n# Therefore, \u00acLessThan(2000, 1500) and \u00acEqualTo(2000, 1500).\n# So, the condition DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) <= 1500 is FALSE.\n\n# This means that Tom will NOT rent an apartment in the Olive Garden, regardless of whether Fluffy is allowed or not.\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500))\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(2000, 1500))\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 False)\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 False\n\n# This seems to be a key conclusion. Let's ensure the predicates are set up correctly to derive this.\n\n# The long disjunction in the original program for DepositAmount is a major issue and should be removed.\n# Instead, we should use comparison predicates.\n\n# Updated premises:\n\n# Explicitly state that $2000 is greater than $1500.\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\n\n# State the actual deposit amount for the Olive Garden.\n# Based on \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\" and RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000),\n# a reasonable concrete value to add is DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n\n# Simplify the deposit requirement for managed buildings.\n# Instead of enumerating values, use a rule that deposit is at least rent.\n# However, the problem states \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# This means that if DepositRequired(x), then there exists some d such that DepositAmount(x, d) AND (d = RentAmount(x, r) OR MoreThan(d, r)).\n# This is hard to model with just predicates if we don't know the specific deposit amount.\n# The original program's long disjunction attempted to cover *possible* deposit amounts, but it's not how it should be done.\n# A more robust approach would be to have a function for deposit amount or a more flexible predicate.\n\n# Given the current predicate structure, explicitly stating the deposit amount for Olive Garden is the most practical way to proceed.\n# And then using comparison predicates.\n\n# Define a rule for when Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building.\n# We need to be careful with quantifiers and the scope of \"managed building\".\n# The rule is for \"a managed building\".\n\n# Rule for Tom renting:\n# Let's use a variable for the deposit amount D.\n\u2200b, D (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 DepositAmount(b, D) \u2227 LessThan(D, 1500) \u2227 AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2192 Rent(tom, b))\n# This is only the \"if\" part of the \"if and only if\".\n# The \"only if\" part:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 Rent(tom, b) \u2192 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(b, D), 1500)))\n\n# Combining these into an \"if and only if\" for a managed building 'b'.\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192\n    (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u2203D (DepositAmount(b, D) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(D, 1500)))))\n\n# Let's apply this to Olive Garden.\n# ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden) is true.\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is true.\n# \u00acMoreThan(2000, 1500) is false because MoreThan(2000, 1500) is true.\n# So, \u2203D (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, D) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(D, 1500)) is false.\n# This makes the right side of the iff false.\n# Therefore, Rent(tom, oliveGarden) must be false.\n\n# We also need to represent that Fluffy is Tom's cat.\n# Owns(tom, fluffy) and Cat(fluffy) implies Pet(fluffy).

Removing the unmanageable disjunction for DepositAmount.\n# 2. Explicitly stating the deposit amount for Olive Garden.\n# 3. Using comparison predicates (MoreThan, LessThan, EqualTo) for deposit limits.\n# 4. Ensuring the \"if and only if\" condition for Tom renting is correctly encoded.\n\n# Let's refine the premises for clarity and correctness based on the above.\n\n# New Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",
