However, the current program uses constants for all mentioned entities.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the task: \"write a new program that is different from this program, which satisfies the same problem.\"\n\n# One way to be \"different\" is to use slightly different constant names if the vocabulary allows for synonyms, but the prompt says \"Generally keep the same vocabulary\".\n\n# Perhaps the \"simplification\" could come from how named entities are handled if there were ambiguity, but here `ailton_silva` is distinct.\n\n# Let's assume the intent is to express the same facts, but with a slightly different structure or emphasis, if possible.\n\n# The original program:\n# BornIn(ailton_silva, 1995).\n# KnownAs(ailton_silva, ailton).\n# FootballPlayer(ailton_silva).\n# LoanedTo(ailton_silva, braga).\n# Brazilian(ailton_silva).\n# PlaysFor(ailton_silva, nautico).\n# FootballClub(nautico).\n# FootballClub(braga).\n# FootballClub(fluminense).\n\n# To be \"different\": We can explicitly state Ailton Silva is a person if we assume `Brazilian` implies `Person`, but it's not a direct implication by the predicate name alone.
