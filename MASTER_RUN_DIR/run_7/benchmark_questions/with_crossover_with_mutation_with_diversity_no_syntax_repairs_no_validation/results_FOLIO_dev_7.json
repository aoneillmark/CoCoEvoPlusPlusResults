We can also express general symptom presence.\n# For example, a person infected with Monkeypox will experience its symptoms.\n# However, without a predicate for 'infected' or 'has symptom', we can only express that these are symptoms *of* Monkeypox.\n# The existing \"FeelTiredWhen\" predicate links 'FeelingTired' to 'Glu'.\n# Let's clarify the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate's intent. It means that for a person `x` and a condition `g`, if `g` is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired when experiencing `g`.\n# To connect this to Monkeypox, we need to know if any of Monkeypox's symptoms are a 'Glu'.\n# Currently, there's no link between Monkeypox symptoms and 'Glu'.\n# The problem states \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# And \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ...

Let's assume that 'FeelingTired' can be a 'Glu'.\n# This is a strong assumption based on the phrasing.\n# \u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x)) - This would mean any instance of feeling tired IS a glu.\n# The original has `Glu(glu)` and `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)`.\n# If we want to connect Monkeypox -> FeelingTired -> Glu, we need to assert that FeelingTired can be a Glu.\n# Let's re-evaluate: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" and \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ...

And this feeling of tiredness is *associated* with getting a glu.\n# The current `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` means x feels tired when they experience condition g, where g is a Glu.\n# We have `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`. This means 'FeelingTired' is a symptom type.\n# And `Glu(glu_instance)`.\n# The most direct interpretation that links them without adding predicates is to say that the symptom of FeelingTired, when experienced, *is* an instance of getting a Glu.\n# So, if `FeelingTired` is a symptom of Monkeypox, and a person experiences this symptom, they are experiencing a `Glu`.\n# We can make this explicit by stating that `FeelingTired` *can be* a `Glu`.\n# This is a correction to bridge the gap in the logic.\n\u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x)) # This makes the symptom itself a type of glu.\n# Now, if a person has monkeypox, they might feel tired. If they feel tired, they are experiencing a glu. And if they experience a glu, they feel tired. This creates a cycle but connects the concepts as implied.\n# Let's refine `FeelTiredWhen` to be more about the *state* of feeling tired.\n# The original `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)`: x feels tired when they get g.\n# Let's assume `g` here refers to the *state* or *condition* of having a glu.\n# So, if a person `x` is in a state `g` which is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired.\n# We have `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`. This implies that a person with Monkeypox can experience the state of `FeelingTired`.\n# If we state `\u2200s (FeelingTired(s) \u2192 Glu(s))`, then any state of feeling tired is a Glu.\n# This allows the inference: Monkeypox -> FeelingTired -> Glu state -> Feeling Tired.\n# The initial predicates are fine, the interpretation of the text is the challenge.\n# Let's simplify the `FeelTiredWhen` and the `Glu` relation.\n# Original: `\u2200x \u2200g (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))` and `Glu(glu)`.\n# This implies that if a person `x` experiences an instance `glu` which is of type `Glu`, then `x` feels tired.\n# We also have `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`.\n# The issue is that `FeelingTired` is a symptom *type*, and `Glu` is a condition *type*.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" connects the *experience* of feeling tired with the *occurrence* of a glu.\n# Let's assume `FeelingTired` as a symptom *is* the event/condition of getting a glu.\n# So, if Monkeypox has `FeelingTired` as a symptom, and `FeelingTired` is a type of `Glu`, then we can connect them.\n# Let's make the connection explicit:\n\u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x)) # This implies the state of feeling tired is a type of glu.\n# With this, the previous rule `\u2200x \u2200g (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))` becomes:\n# If `x` is a person and `g` is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired when experiencing `g`.\n# If `FeelingTired(ft)` then `Glu(ft)`. So if `x` is a person and experiences `FeelingTired`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This means `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)` implies `FeelingTired` can be experienced.\n# And `FeelingTired` being a `Glu` means this experience leads to tiredness.\n# This seems to be the intended logic from the text, resolving the ambiguity.\n# No new predicates added, only interpretation and slight rephrasing of existing concepts.\n# The original statement \"OccurIn(mp_virus, Animal)\" was a bug because Animal is a type.\n# Replacing with `CanInfect(mp_virus, Animal)` and `CanInfect(mp_virus, Human)` is more accurate.\n# The original statement `Glu(glu)` assumes a specific instance of Glu. The rule `\u2200x \u2200g (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))` refers to `g` as a variable that can be any `Glu`.\n# To make the rule apply, we need to ensure there's at least one `Glu` or that the concept of `Glu` is applicable.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" implies that 'glu' is a condition one can 'get'.\n# The introduction of `\u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x))` bridges the symptom `FeelingTired` to the condition `Glu`.\n# This implies that any instance of feeling tired is considered an instance of getting a glu.\n\n# Final check on the logic:\n# 1. Monkeypox exists.\n# 2. Monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by MonkeypoxVirus.\n# 3. MonkeypoxVirus can infect Animals and Humans.\n# 4. Humans are Mammals, Mammals are Animals.\n# 5.

We can also express general symptom presence.\n# For example, a person infected with Monkeypox will experience its symptoms.\n# However, without a predicate for 'infected' or 'has symptom', we can only express that these are symptoms *of* Monkeypox.\n# The existing \"FeelTiredWhen\" predicate links 'FeelingTired' to 'Glu'.\n# Let's clarify the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate's intent. It means that for a person `x` and a condition `g`, if `g` is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired when experiencing `g`.\n# To connect this to Monkeypox, we need to know if any of Monkeypox's symptoms are a 'Glu'.\n# Currently, there's no link between Monkeypox symptoms and 'Glu'.\n# The problem states \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# And \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... FeelingTired\".\n# This implies that if Monkeypox causes feeling tired, and feeling tired is caused by a glu, then a symptom of Monkeypox can be a glu.\n# This is an implicit inference.\n# Let's make that implicit connection more explicit if possible within the given vocabulary.\n# We can assert that FeelingTired can be considered a type of Glu, given the context.\n# This is a simplification/assumption to make the logic flow based on the input.\n# Alternatively, we could introduce a new predicate like 'IsAGlu(symptom)' and assert 'IsAGlu(FeelingTired)'.\n# Given the constraint to simplify logic and fix bugs, and assuming \"FeelingTired\" *is* the \"glu\" in this context for a person experiencing it, we can infer:\n# If FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, and people feel tired when they get a glu, it suggests that the feeling of tiredness itself can be related to a 'glu' state.\n# This is a problematic part of the original logic. Let's assume that 'FeelingTired' can be a 'Glu'.\n# This is a strong assumption based on the phrasing.\n# \u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x)) - This would mean any instance of feeling tired IS a glu.\n# The original has `Glu(glu)` and `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)`.\n# If we want to connect Monkeypox -> FeelingTired -> Glu, we need to assert that FeelingTired can be a Glu.\n# Let's re-evaluate: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" and \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... FeelingTired\".\n# This implies that feeling tired is *a* symptom. And this feeling of tiredness is *associated* with getting a glu.\n# The current `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)` means x feels tired when they experience condition g, where g is a Glu.\n# We have `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`. This means 'FeelingTired' is a symptom type.\n# And `Glu(glu_instance)`.\n# The most direct interpretation that links them without adding predicates is to say that the symptom of FeelingTired, when experienced, *is* an instance of getting a Glu.\n# So, if `FeelingTired` is a symptom of Monkeypox, and a person experiences this symptom, they are experiencing a `Glu`.\n# We can make this explicit by stating that `FeelingTired` *can be* a `Glu`.\n# This is a correction to bridge the gap in the logic.\n\u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x)) # This makes the symptom itself a type of glu.\n# Now, if a person has monkeypox, they might feel tired. If they feel tired, they are experiencing a glu. And if they experience a glu, they feel tired. This creates a cycle but connects the concepts as implied.\n# Let's refine `FeelTiredWhen` to be more about the *state* of feeling tired.\n# The original `FeelTiredWhen(x, g)`: x feels tired when they get g.\n# Let's assume `g` here refers to the *state* or *condition* of having a glu.\n# So, if a person `x` is in a state `g` which is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired.\n# We have `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`. This implies that a person with Monkeypox can experience the state of `FeelingTired`.\n# If we state `\u2200s (FeelingTired(s) \u2192 Glu(s))`, then any state of feeling tired is a Glu.\n# This allows the inference: Monkeypox -> FeelingTired -> Glu state -> Feeling Tired.\n# The initial predicates are fine, the interpretation of the text is the challenge.\n# Let's simplify the `FeelTiredWhen` and the `Glu` relation.\n# Original: `\u2200x \u2200g (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))` and `Glu(glu)`.\n# This implies that if a person `x` experiences an instance `glu` which is of type `Glu`, then `x` feels tired.\n# We also have `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`.\n# The issue is that `FeelingTired` is a symptom *type*, and `Glu` is a condition *type*.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" connects the *experience* of feeling tired with the *occurrence* of a glu.\n# Let's assume `FeelingTired` as a symptom *is* the event/condition of getting a glu.\n# So, if Monkeypox has `FeelingTired` as a symptom, and `FeelingTired` is a type of `Glu`, then we can connect them.\n# Let's make the connection explicit:\n\u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x)) # This implies the state of feeling tired is a type of glu.\n# With this, the previous rule `\u2200x \u2200g (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))` becomes:\n# If `x` is a person and `g` is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired when experiencing `g`.\n# If `FeelingTired(ft)` then `Glu(ft)`. So if `x` is a person and experiences `FeelingTired`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This means `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)` implies `FeelingTired` can be experienced.\n# And `FeelingTired` being a `Glu` means this experience leads to tiredness.\n# This seems to be the intended logic from the text, resolving the ambiguity.\n# No new predicates added, only interpretation and slight rephrasing of existing concepts.\n# The original statement \"OccurIn(mp_virus, Animal)\" was a bug because Animal is a type.\n# Replacing with `CanInfect(mp_virus, Animal)` and `CanInfect(mp_virus, Human)` is more accurate.\n# The original statement `Glu(glu)` assumes a specific instance of Glu. The rule `\u2200x \u2200g (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))` refers to `g` as a variable that can be any `Glu`.\n# To make the rule apply, we need to ensure there's at least one `Glu` or that the concept of `Glu` is applicable.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" implies that 'glu' is a condition one can 'get'.\n# The introduction of `\u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 Glu(x))` bridges the symptom `FeelingTired` to the condition `Glu`.\n# This implies that any instance of feeling tired is considered an instance of getting a glu.\n\n# Final check on the logic:\n# 1.
