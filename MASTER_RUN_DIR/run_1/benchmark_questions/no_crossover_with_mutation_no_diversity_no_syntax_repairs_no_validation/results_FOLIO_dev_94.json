This is likely a misunderstanding of how `LessThan` should be used.\n# `LessThan(a, b)` means `a < b`.\n# So, `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` would mean \"the security deposit amount for building x is less than 1500, and that amount is 1500\". This is contradictory.\n# The correct way to express \"deposit is no more than $1500\" is `DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 (d < 1500 \u2228 d = 1500)`.\n# Or, if we have a `LessThanOrEqual` predicate, `DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 LessThanOrEqual(d, 1500)`.\n# Given the predicates, we can use `LessThan(d, 1501)` or infer it from `LessThan(d, 1500) \u2228 Equal(d, 1500)`.\n# Let's define a new predicate for clarity or use the existing ones carefully.\n# The premise states \"the security deposit is no more than $1500\". This means DepositAmount(x, d) and d <= 1500.\n# The original program had: `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500))))`\n# This is incorrect. Let's correct it to express `DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 d <= 1500`.\n# We can use `LessThan(d, 1501)` or `NOT MoreThan(d, 1500)`.\n# The problem explicitly states \"2000$ is more than $1500.\" So `MoreThan(2000, 1500)` is given.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the logic for Tom renting:\n# `Rent(tom, b)` if and only if `ManagedBuilding(b)` AND `AllowedPet(fluffy, b)` AND `DepositAmount(b, d)` AND `d <= 1500`.\n\n# The original premise was:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500))))\n# This is flawed.

Then `LessThan(1500, 1500)` is false.\n# The intention was likely to check if the deposit amount is <= 1500.\n\n# Let's ensure all original premises are covered and corrected.\n# 1. Pets are allowed in some managed buildings. -> Covered by general premise existence or inferred.\n# 2. A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building. -> \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 DepositRequired(x))\n# 3.

This is a typo, it should be LessThan(DepositAmount(x, y), 1500) where y is the actual deposit amount.\n# Let's correct this:\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500)))).\n# Now we need to state the actual deposit amount for Olive Garden.\n# If the deposit is $2000, then DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# In this case, LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), 1500) is false.\n# If the deposit is less than $1500, then LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d), 1500) would be true for some d < 1500.\n# Let's assume the deposit is $1000 for demonstration purposes to make the LessThan condition true.\n# However, we must respect the \"equal to one month's rent or more\" rule. Rent is $2000. So deposit must be >= $2000.\n# This implies that the condition LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, y), 1500) will *always* be false if DepositAmount(oliveGarden, y) >= 2000.\n# This means Tom will *never* rent at Olive Garden under these conditions.\n# Let's re-read \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\" This is a general rule for managed buildings.\n# And \"The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\"\n# And \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\"\n# The original premise \"MoreThan(2000, 1500)\" is true, but it relates rent to 1500, not the deposit.\n# The crucial part is `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)`. This predicate implies a comparison of the *deposit amount* with $1500.\n# The parameter `1500` in `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` is likely a placeholder and should be the actual deposit amount.\n# Let's assume the intended predicate was `LessThan(DepositAmount(x), 1500)`.\n# To fix this, let's use a placeholder for the deposit amount and then assert it.\n\n# Corrected interpretation of the rental condition and deposit.\n# The security deposit for Olive Garden is *at least* one month's rent. Rent is $2000. So, DepositAmount(oliveGarden) >= 2000.\n# Tom rents if DepositAmount(oliveGarden) <= 1500.\n# Since DepositAmount(oliveGarden) >= 2000 and DepositAmount(oliveGarden) <= 1500 cannot both be true, Tom will not rent at Olive Garden if he's allowed to bring Fluffy.\n# Let's clarify this by asserting the deposit amount.\n# Based on the general rule, deposit >= rent.

Let's assume the given facts are sacrosanct.\n# The issue lies in the definition of `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent` and `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent`.\n# The rule implies that for any managed building `x`, if there is a deposit `y`, then either `y = RentAmount(x,z)` or `y > RentAmount(x,z)`.\n# For Olive Garden, `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 1500)` and `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`.\n# The condition `1500 = 2000` is false.

This seems to go against the explicit statement.\n# Option 3: The predicates `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent` and `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent` are intended to be the *definitions* of those terms, and the first rule is an axiom that *must* hold for all managed buildings.\n# Given the task is to fix bugs/simplify, and the current logic leads to a contradiction, we should ensure consistency.\n# The most direct fix that respects the explicit numbers given is to make the rule about deposit amounts more permissive or rephrase it.\n# However, \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\" is a strong statement.\n# Let's assume the rule intends to mean that for any managed building `x`, IF a deposit amount `y` is established, THEN `y` must be at least as much as the rent.\n# Since `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 1500)` and `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`, this is violated.\n# The most consistent approach is to assume the problem meant that the deposit for Olive Garden is $2000.\n# Let's try to fix it by adjusting the deposit amount to be consistent with the rule.\n\n# Revised premises to ensure consistency with the rule about deposits:\n# ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden).\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# Fluffy(fluffy).\n# Tom(tom).\n# Owns(tom, fluffy).\n# Cat(fluffy).\n# Pet(fluffy).\n\n# Rules about pets and cats:\n# \u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x)).\n\n# Rules about managed buildings:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 DepositRequired(x)).\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x, y) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x, y)))).\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x, y) \u2192 y = RentAmount(x, z)).\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2227 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x, y) \u2192 MoreThan(y, RentAmount(x, z))).\n\n# Rules about pets in managed buildings:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x)).\n\n# Rules about Tom renting an apartment:\n# \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThanOrEqualTo(DepositAmount(x, y), 1500)))).\n\n# Specific facts and constraints for Olive Garden:\n# The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# For Olive Garden to be a managed building, its security deposit must be equal to or more than one month's rent.\n# So, DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# This implies DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# MoreThan(2000, 1500). # Still a valid statement.\n\n# This revised approach changes the deposit amount, which might not be ideal if the original numbers are strict.\n# Let's stick to the original numbers and address the predicate definition issue.\n# The core issue is:\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 1500).\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# MoreThan(2000, 1500). -> means LessThan(1500, 2000).\n# Rule: \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 \u2203y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x, y) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x, y)))).\n# And definitions:\n# DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x, y) if y = RentAmount(x, z)\n# DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x, y) if MoreThan(y, RentAmount(x, z))\n# The current encoding implies that for Olive Garden, the deposit of $1500 is NEITHER equal to nor greater than the rent of $2000.\n# This violates the rule about managed buildings.\n# To fix, we can relax the strict requirement on `y` in the existential.\n# Instead of `\u2203y (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x, y) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x, y)))`,\n# we can simply state that the deposit amount must be >= rent, or that the rule is misstated.\n# \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\" This implies that for any managed building, the deposit must satisfy this.\n# The current predicates make it impossible for Olive Garden to satisfy this with the given numbers.\n# Simplest fix: Assume the statement \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\" is a general descriptive statement, and the specific rules for DepositEqualToOneMonthRent and DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent are the operative ones.\n# The contradiction arises because the existential rule for ManagedBuilding requires the deposit to satisfy one of those relative-to-rent conditions.\n# Let's infer the conditions for Olive Garden directly based on the given numbers.\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 1500).
