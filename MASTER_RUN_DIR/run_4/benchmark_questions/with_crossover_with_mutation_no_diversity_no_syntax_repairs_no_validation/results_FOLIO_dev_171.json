Simplification of Bile Duct Cancer and Severe Cancer:\n# The statement \"Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer\" can be more generally expressed if we assume `bileDuctCancer` is a type.\n# However, given the current structure, it's likely intended to refer to a specific instance or type.\n# If \"bileDuctCancer\" is intended as a constant representing the *type* of disease, the original is fine.\n# If it's meant to be a specific instance of bile duct cancer, then the original is also fine.\n# For clarity and to avoid potential ambiguity with `IsA`, we will keep it as is, assuming `bileDuctCancer` is treated as a type constant for the purpose of this encoding.\n\n# 2. Redundancy Check:\n# The rule `(BileDuctCancer(colorectalCancer) \u2227 LowSurvivalRate(colorectalCancer)) \u2192 \u00acBileDuctCancer(colorectalCancer)`\n# is an interesting logical statement. It implies that if colorectal cancer were a bile duct cancer *and* had a low survival rate, it would lead to a contradiction (that it's not a bile duct cancer).\n# This kind of rule is often used in formalizing non-monotonic reasoning or to express properties that cannot hold simultaneously.\n# In a standard first-order logic context, this implies that the premise `(BileDuctCancer(colorectalCancer) \u2227 LowSurvivalRate(colorectalCancer))` cannot be true if the system is consistent.\n# This rule is already well-formed and doesn't necessarily require a fix, but its implications are worth noting.\n\n# 3.

Consistency of terms:\n# The terms `bileDuctCancer`, `colorectalCancer` are treated as constants representing specific diseases or types of diseases.\n# This is consistent with the use of predicates like `SevereCancer(bileDuctCancer)`.\n\n# 5. Missing implications for Cholangiocarcinoma and Severe Cancer:\n# From the rules, we can infer:\n#   - Bile duct cancer is a deadly disease (SevereCancer(bileDuctCancer) -> DeadlyDisease(bileDuctCancer) -> LowSurvivalRate(bileDuctCancer)).\n#   - Cholangiocarcinoma has a low survival rate (Cholangiocarcinoma(x) -> BileDuctCancer(x); BileDuctCancer(x) implies it's a SevereCancer if BileDuctCancer itself is classified as a SevereCancer. This requires a clarification: is `bileDuctCancer` a *type* that is severe cancer, or a specific *instance*? The current phrasing `SevereCancer(bileDuctCancer)` suggests `bileDuctCancer` is a specific type of entity being classified as a severe cancer).\n# Assuming `bileDuctCancer` is a type of cancer that is severe:\n#   - Then `bileDuctCancer` is a deadly disease.\n#   - Then `bileDuctCancer` has a low survival rate.\n#   - Then any `x` that is Cholangiocarcinoma is also a BileDuctCancer.\n#   - Thus, any `x` that is Cholangiocarcinoma is also a SevereCancer (if BileDuctCancer is a SevereCancer).\n#   - Thus, any `x` that is Cholangiocarcinoma is a DeadlyDisease.\n#   - Thus, any `x` that is Cholangiocarcinoma has a LowSurvivalRate.\n\n# Let's refine the premises to explicitly include these derived relationships for clarity and to cover potential implicit assumptions:\n\n# Explicitly stating that bile duct cancer is a deadly disease and has a low survival rate.\nDeadlyDisease(bileDuctCancer)\nLowSurvivalRate(bileDuctCancer)\n\n# Explicitly stating that Cholangiocarcinoma inherits the properties of Bile Duct Cancer, and thus of Severe Cancer, Deadly Disease, and Low Survival Rate.\n\u2200x (Cholangiocarcinoma(x) \u2192 SevereCancer(x))\n\u2200x (Cholangiocarcinoma(x) \u2192 DeadlyDisease(x))\n\u2200x (Cholangiocarcinoma(x) \u2192 LowSurvivalRate(x))\n\n# The rule about colorectal cancer is already a strong logical constraint.\n# `(BileDuctCancer(colorectalCancer) \u2227 LowSurvivalRate(colorectalCancer)) \u2192 \u00acBileDuctCancer(colorectalCancer)`\n# This rule essentially states that `colorectalCancer` cannot be both a `BileDuctCancer` and have a `LowSurvivalRate`.\n\n# Considering edge cases:\n# - What if something is *not* a deadly disease?
