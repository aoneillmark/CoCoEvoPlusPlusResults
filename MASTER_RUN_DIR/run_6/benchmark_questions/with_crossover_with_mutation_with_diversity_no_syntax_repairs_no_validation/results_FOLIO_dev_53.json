Language families are not typically related to languages. If it means entities that ARE language families are not related to OTHER entities that ARE language families, it's a different statement. Given the context, it's likely a confusion, or it implies language families themselves aren't \"languages\" in the \"related\" sense. Removing as it doesn't directly contribute to the stated relationships between languages and seems to impose a constraint on the 'LanguageFamily' predicate itself that isn't used elsewhere. If it's meant to say language families are not related to languages, that's usually implicit. If it means two different language families are not related, that's also plausible but not directly supported by the scenario.\n# \u2200x \u2200y (Related(x, y) \u2192 Related(y, x)) - kept\n# \u2200x \u00ac(French(x) \u2227 Spanish(x) \u2227 German(x) \u2227 Basque(x)) - Replaced with specific individual distinctness premises.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acRomanceLanguage(german)\n",

Language families are not typically related to languages. If it means entities that ARE language families are not related to OTHER entities that ARE language families, it's a different statement. Given the context, it's likely a confusion, or it implies language families themselves aren't \"languages\" in the \"related\" sense. Removing as it doesn't directly contribute to the stated relationships between languages and seems to impose a constraint on the 'LanguageFamily' predicate itself that isn't used elsewhere. If it's meant to say language families are not related to languages, that's usually implicit. If it means two different language families are not related, that's also plausible but not directly supported by the scenario.\n# \u2200x \u2200y (Related(x, y) \u2192 Related(y, x)) - kept\n# \u2200x \u00ac(French(x) \u2227 Spanish(x) \u2227 German(x) \u2227 Basque(x)) - Replaced with specific individual distinctness premises.\n\n# Conclusion:\nRomanceLanguage(french) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(french)\n",
