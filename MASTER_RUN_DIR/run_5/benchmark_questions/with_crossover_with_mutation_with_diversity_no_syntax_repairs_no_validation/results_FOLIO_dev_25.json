Some universities rank in Asia-Pacific, and some rank in the world. (Covered by original)\n# 2. Some universities rank in BOTH Asia-Pacific and the world.\n# 3. The same set of \"many\" universities rank in both.\n\n# Given the phrasing, interpretation 1 or 2 are most likely. The current encoding supports interpretation 1.\n# To more strongly support \"many\", we could introduce a constant for \"a university\" and then state multiple existentials,\n# but that feels less general.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the original premises:\n# \u2203u (University(u) \u2227 Location(u, beijing) \u2227 Rank(u, asiaPacific))\n# \u2203v (University(v) \u2227 Location(v, beijing) \u2227 Rank(v, world))\n# These two premises correctly capture that there exist universities in Beijing that are ranked in Asia-Pacific and that there exist universities in Beijing that are ranked in the world.\n# The word \"consistently\" implies a degree of reliability or repeated occurrence, which is difficult to formalize without temporal logic or more specific predicates about ranking stability.\n# \"Many\" implies plurality. The existential quantifiers confirm existence, which is a weaker form of plurality.\n\n# Simplified logic and edge cases:\n# - The distinction between `games2008SummerOlympics` and `summerOlympics` as separate event identifiers for the same type of event is redundant. Using a single identifier per event type is cleaner.\n# - The current premises for hosting Olympics/Paralympics already capture Beijing hosting Summer and Winter Olympics/Paralympics generally. The specific 2008 games are also listed. This is fine, but if the goal was just to say Beijing hosted Summer and Winter Olympics/Paralympics *at some point*, the `summerOlympics` etc. premises suffice. The 2008 premises add specificity.\n\n# The current encoding seems mostly correct for the provided text.\n# Let's simplify by removing the redundancy of specific named games if the general type is already stated.\n# If `summerOlympics` is meant to represent *any* Summer Olympics, then `games2008SummerOlympics` is a specific instance.\n# The original program lists both:\n# Host(beijing, games2008SummerOlympics) AND Host(beijing, summerOlympics)\n# This implies `summerOlympics` is a category or a specific generic instance.\n# If `summerOlympics` refers to a *type* of event (e.g., \"the concept of Summer Olympics\"), then it's odd to `Host` a concept.\n# It's more likely that `summerOlympics` refers to *a* specific (but unspecified) Summer Olympics event.\n# Let's assume `summerOlympics`, `winterOlympics`, etc. are general event identifiers that *can* be hosted.\n\n# To improve clarity and potentially avoid ambiguity:\n# - Use consistent naming for events. If `games2008SummerOlympics` is a specific event, then `summerOlympics` likely refers to a generic placeholder for any Summer Olympics.\n# - The premise `Host(beijing, summerOlympics)` implies Beijing hosted *some* Summer Olympics. The premise `Host(beijing, games2008SummerOlympics)` implies Beijing hosted the *specific* 2008 Summer Olympics. This is not contradictory.\n\n# Let's refine the university ranking part.\n# \"Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.\"\n# This implies:\n# 1. There are many universities in Beijing (approx 91).\n# 2. Some of these universities rank among the best in Asia-Pacific.\n# 3. Some of these universities rank among the best in the world.\n# 4. The ranking is consistent.\n\n# The current premises:\n# \u2203u (University(u) \u2227 Location(u, beijing) \u2227 Rank(u, asiaPacific))\n# \u2203v (University(v) \u2227 Location(v, beijing) \u2227 Rank(v, world))\n# These fulfill points 2 and 3, by asserting existence. \"Many\" is weakly represented by existence.\n# The number \"91\" is very specific and difficult to encode without a counting mechanism.\n# \"Consistently\" is also hard to formalize.\n\n# Let's stick to the core information that can be directly translated.\n# The original premises for universities are reasonable translations of \"Some universities rank in the Asia-Pacific and some in the world.\"\n\n# Revisiting redundancy:\n# The original program has:\n# Host(beijing, games2008SummerOlympics)\n# Host(beijing, summerOlympics)\n# If `summerOlympics` is a generic event placeholder for \"a Summer Olympics\", then the first premise is more specific.\n# If the goal is to say Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics AND it has hosted Summer Olympics in general, then both are valid.\n\n# Given the task is to fix bugs, add edge cases, or simplify logic, let's consider:\n# - Bug: No apparent logical bugs in the premises as stated.\n# - Edge cases: The \"many\" and \"consistently\" aspects are somewhat underspecified in the current logic, but adding complex logic for these without more context might overstep.\n# - Simplification: The distinction between `games2008SummerOlympics` and `summerOlympics` might be simplified if the intent is just to state Beijing hosted Summer Olympics. However, the scenario mentions specific games and also general hosting.\n\n# Let's assume the intention is:\n# 1. Beijing is China's capital.\n# 2. Beijing is populous.\n# 3. Beijing is in Northern China.\n# 4. Beijing hosted specific 2008 events.\n# 5. Beijing has hosted Summer/Winter Olympics and Paralympics (general statement).\n# 6.
