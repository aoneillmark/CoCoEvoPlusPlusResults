If `pierre` is a `City`, this predicate `In(x, City)` is ambiguous.\n# Let's remove the problematic premise as it's ill-defined with current predicates and vocabulary.\n# The information about Pierre not being in Montana is already captured.\n# And the fact that Butte and White Sulphur Springs are in the same state (Montana) is also captured by `SameState(butte, white_sulphur_springs)` and `In(butte, montana)`, `In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)`.\n# The simplest approach is to remove the premise that uses `In(x, butte)` as `butte` is a City.\n\n# Let's try to keep the original faulty premise and reinterpret it.\n# `\u2200x (City(x) \u2227 In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))`\n# The only way `In(x, butte)` makes sense is if `butte` is considered a 'region' in some abstract sense.\n# But the problem statement clearly defines `butte` as a `City`.\n# If we assume the scenario statement \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre\" implies:\n# For any city `x`, if `x` is in the state of Montana, then `x` is not in Pierre.\n# This requires a way to say `x` is in Montana.

So, for the given entities, it holds.\n#    But it's a bug if we consider the general case of states.\n#    A fix could be to make `montana` explicit in the `SameState` definition or remove this general rule and rely on explicit facts.\n#    Given \"White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state.\", and we know `In(butte, montana)`, then `In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)` is implied.\n#    Let's simplify and ensure `SameState` implies they are in *some* state, and then use explicit facts.\n#    `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 \u2203S (State(S) \u2227 In(x, S) \u2227 In(y, S)))` is more general.\n#    But the problem specifically mentions Montana.\n\n#    Let's re-evaluate premise 7 based on context:\n#    \"Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula. White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state.\"\n#    This implies Butte is in Montana. And White Sulphur Springs is in the same state as Butte. So White Sulphur Springs is also in Montana.\n#    The premise `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 In(x, montana) \u2194 In(y, montana))` might be intended to capture this for all `SameState` relationships.\n#    Given the limited entities, it works. But if there were cities in California that were `SameState`, this rule would incorrectly place them in Montana.\n#    A better formulation is: `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 \u2203S (State(S) \u2227 In(x, S) \u2227 In(y, S)))`\n#    Or if `In(x, montana)` is the only relevant state for `SameState` for the given problem:\n#    `SameState(butte, white_sulphur_springs)` implies `In(butte, montana)` and `In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)`.\n#    The rule might be intended to mean: if two cities are in the same state, they are either BOTH in Montana, or NEITHER are in Montana.\n#    This implies that `montana` is one of the possible states, not the only one for `SameState`.\n#    The current rule `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 In(x, montana) \u2194 In(y, montana))` is problematic if there are other states.\n#    It implies `In(x, montana) \u2192 In(y, montana)` and `In(y, montana) \u2192 In(x, montana)`.\n#    This means all cities in the same state must be in Montana. This is a bug.\n\n#    Fix for premise 7:\n#    The fact is \"White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state.\"\n#    We know `In(butte, montana)`.\n#    This implies `In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)`.\n#    We can add this as a specific fact.\n#    `City(white_sulphur_springs) \u2227 In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)` is already present.\n#    So, premise 7 is redundant if we already list all facts.\n#    Let's simplify and make `SameState` just a relation, and infer `In` from facts.\n\n# 8. `\u2200x (City(x) \u2227 In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` - As discussed, this is buggy due to `In(x, butte)` where `butte` is a City.\n#    The intention seems to be that cities in Montana are not in Pierre.\n#    Given `butte` is in Montana, this is like saying cities in Butte's state are not in Pierre.\n#    A direct fix, assuming `In(x, pierre)` is meaningful:\n#    Replace with `\u2200x (City(x) \u2227 In(x, montana) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))`.\n#    However, this requires `pierre` to be a \"location\" that cities can be \"in\", which conflicts with it being defined as a `City` in `City(pierre)`.\n#    The simplest approach is to remove this premise as it's ill-defined given the provided predicates and entities.

But if there were cities in California that were `SameState`, this rule would incorrectly place them in Montana.\n#    A better formulation is: `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 \u2203S (State(S) \u2227 In(x, S) \u2227 In(y, S)))`\n#    Or if `In(x, montana)` is the only relevant state for `SameState` for the given problem:\n#    `SameState(butte, white_sulphur_springs)` implies `In(butte, montana)` and `In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)`.\n#    The rule might be intended to mean: if two cities are in the same state, they are either BOTH in Montana, or NEITHER are in Montana.\n#    This implies that `montana` is one of the possible states, not the only one for `SameState`.\n#    The current rule `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 In(x, montana) \u2194 In(y, montana))` is problematic if there are other states.\n#    It implies `In(x, montana) \u2192 In(y, montana)` and `In(y, montana) \u2192 In(x, montana)`.\n#    This means all cities in the same state must be in Montana.

The fact `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)` is already there.\n\n# Revised Premises:\nCity(billings)\nCity(butte)\nCity(helena)\nCity(missoula)\nCity(white_sulphur_springs)\nCity(pierre)\nState(montana)\n\nIn(billings, montana)\nIn(butte, montana)\nIn(helena, montana)\nIn(missoula, montana)\nIn(white_sulphur_springs, montana)\n\u00acIn(pierre, montana)\n\nSameState(butte, white_sulphur_springs)\n\n# Additional Rule to capture \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre.\"\n# Interpretation: Pierre is distinct from Montana. Since Butte is in Montana, cities in Montana are not in Pierre.\n# This doesn't require `In(x, pierre)`. It just states a fact about Pierre's location.\n# We already have `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)`. This statement might be redundant or intended to mean that Pierre is a city that is not a state, and therefore cities cannot be \"in\" it in the same way they are in states.\n# Given `City(pierre)`, the premise `\u2200x (City(x) \u2227 In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` is faulty because `In(x, butte)` is not a standard relation.\n# The most faithful approach that simplifies and fixes bugs is to remove the ill-defined premise and rely on explicit facts.\n# The scenario states \"The city of Pierre is not in Montana.\" This is covered.\n# The scenario states \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre.\" Given Butte is in Montana, this implies cities in Montana are not in Pierre.\n# Since we have `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)`, this reinforces that Pierre is in a different region.\n# The most straightforward fix is to remove the faulty premise and rely on existing facts.\n# The statement is redundant or poorly formulated given the predicates.\n# If `In(x, y)` means `x` is a city in `y` (a state), then `In(x, butte)` is invalid.\n# The statement is likely trying to say that the location `pierre` is separate from `montana`.\n# We already have `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)`. This is sufficient.\n\n# Final thoughts on premise 7: `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 In(x, montana) \u2194 In(y, montana))`\n# This rule implies that if two cities are in the same state, they are BOTH in Montana OR NEITHER are in Montana.\n# This is wrong if there are other states. Example: if Boulder and Denver are in Colorado, and SameState(boulder, denver), then this rule would say In(boulder, montana) <=> In(denver, montana). This is false.\n# The correct rule would be: `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 \u2203S (State(S) \u2227 In(x, S) \u2227 In(y, S)))`\n# Or, more specific to the problem: `SameState(butte, white_sulphur_springs)` implies they are in the same state.\n# Since `In(butte, montana)` is a fact, then `In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)` must also be true.\n# We can add `In(white_sulphur_springs, montana)` as a specific fact, which is already there.\n# So, premise 7 is not strictly needed if we list all the individual `In` facts.\n# For simplification, it's better to list the specific facts for the cities given.\n\n# Final revised premises:\nCity(billings)\nCity(butte)\nCity(helena)\nCity(missoula)\nCity(white_sulphur_springs)\nCity(pierre)\nState(montana)\n\nIn(billings, montana)\nIn(butte, montana)\nIn(helena, montana)\nIn(missoula, montana)\nIn(white_sulphur_springs, montana)\n\u00acIn(pierre, montana)\n\nSameState(butte, white_sulphur_springs)\n\n# Explanation for removed premises:\n# - `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 In(x, montana) \u2194 In(y, montana))` was removed because it incorrectly implies all cities in the same state must be in Montana. The individual `In` facts for each city are sufficient for the given scenario.\n# - `\u2200x (City(x) \u2227 In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` was removed because `In(x, butte)` is ill-formed as `butte` is a City, not a State. The core information that Pierre is distinct from Montana is already captured by `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)`.\n\n# Re-checking: \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre.\"\n# If `In(x, y)` is `x is a city in y`, and `y` is a state.\n# Then `In(x, butte)` is invalid.\n# The sentence is likely reinforcing that Pierre is a separate location from Montana and its cities.\n# We already have `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)`. This is sufficient.\n# If we *had* to include a rule for this:\n# `\u2200x (City(x) \u2227 In(x, montana) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))`\n# This would make sense if `In(x, pierre)` was defined as \"city x is in the region of pierre\".\n# But with `City(pierre)`, `In(x, pierre)` remains awkward.\n\n# Let's strictly adhere to the given vocabulary and predicates.\n# The original program has:\n# `City(billings) \u2227 In(billings, montana)`\n# ... and similar for other cities in Montana.\n# `City(pierre) \u2227 \u00acIn(pierre, montana)`\n# `\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 In(x, montana) \u2194 In(y, montana))` -> BUG: assumes all cities in same state are in Montana.\n# `\u2200x (City(x) \u2227 In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` -> BUG: `In(x, butte)` is invalid as `butte` is a City.\n\n# The task is to fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\n# My proposed solution simplifies by removing redundant/buggy general rules and relying on specific facts, which is a simplification and bug fix.\n# I will add the `SameState` premise as a standalone fact, as the general rule for it was buggy.\n# And I will remove the other buggy premise.\n\n==================\n# Premises:\nCity(billings)\nCity(butte)\nCity(helena)\nCity(missoula)\nCity(white_sulphur_springs)\nCity(pierre)\nState(montana)\n\nIn(billings, montana)\nIn(butte, montana)\nIn(helena, montana)\nIn(missoula, montana)\nIn(white_sulphur_springs, montana)\n\u00acIn(pierre, montana)\n\nSameState(butte, white_sulphur_springs)\n==================\n\n# Conclusion:\nIn(missoula, montana)\n",
