My current has `Block(michael, x)`.\n# The sentence \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" suggests `\u00acBlock(michael, windy)`.\n# This implies Block(x, y) means \"x can block y's shooting\".\n\n# Final list of premises to include:\n# Individuals\nMan(michael).\nMan(peter).\nMan(windy).\n\n# Type hierarchy if not implicitly handled by Man(x) -> Person(x) rule\nPerson(michael).\nPerson(peter).\nPerson(windy).\n\n# Height\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (Taller(x, y) \u2227 Taller(y, z) \u2192 Taller(x, z))\nTaller(peter, michael).\n# \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\"\n# This means for all x, if x is a classmate of Michael, then Michael is taller than x.\n# Let's assume Class(x) means \"x is in Michael's class\".\n\u2200x (Class(x) \u2192 Taller(michael, x))\n\n# Blocking\n# \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n\u2200x \u2200y ((Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y)) \u2192 Block(x, y))\n\n# \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# This implies that if someone is a shooter and does not jump, Michael can block their shooting.\n\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n\n# \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.\"\n\u00acBlock(michael, windy)\n\n# Great Shooter\n\u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 Jump(x) \u2192 GreatShooter(x))\n\n# Added clarifications/corrections from analysis:\n# The original program had duplicate `\u2200x (Man(x) \u2192 Person(x))` lines. Only one is needed.\n# The original premise `\u2200x (Man(x) \u2227 Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Class(x))` was a misinterpretation of the scenario. It has been replaced.\n# The predicate `Shooting(y)` was used in `Block(michael, Shooting(x))`. The interpretation `Block(michael, x)` meaning \"Michael can block x's shooting\" is simpler and consistent with `\u00acBlock(michael, Windy)`.\n\n# Conclusion:\nBlock(peter, windy)\n",
