If Mike wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT. (Specific rule for Mike)\n# 4. If Mike is an international student in the US and wants to work, he needs CPT. (General rule, covers J1 case)\n# 5. If Mike is an international student in the US, has F1, and wants to work, he needs CPT or OPT. (General rule for F1)\n\n# The general rule \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) is the most encompassing for CPT.\n# The specific rule for Mike (Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())) is redundant if the general rule for all international students is present and Mike is an international student.\n# However, the prompt asks to fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\n# The previous program had the general rule for all IS in US: \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x)) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# and also the specific rule for Mike: \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x)) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) (this was same as general rule)\n# and then another rule: \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x)) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())))\n# And the specific rule for Mike: \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x)) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) was also repeated for Mike.\n# The scenario states: \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" This is a direct statement.\n# The previous code seemed to have duplicate or overly general rules.\n\n# Let's use the specific rule for Mike and the general rules from the scenario.\n# 1. International students in US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n# 2. An international student in US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.\n# 3. Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n\n# If we include the specific rule for Mike, it directly addresses his situation.\n# If Mike has J1, the F1 rule doesn't apply. The scenario doesn't specify J1 requirements.\n# If we don't include a general rule for *all* IS in US, then J1 cases are underspecified for working.\n# The original program did have \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x)) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# This rule is important to cover cases not explicitly detailed, like J1 students working.\n\n# Revised plan:\n# Keep the core facts.\n# Keep the F1 rule for CPT/OPT.\n# Keep the specific rule for Mike.\n# Re-introduce the general rule for all international students in the US wanting to work (which implies CPT is needed). This ensures J1 cases are covered.\n# Simplify by removing redundant or less specific rules if the more specific ones cover the logic.\n\n# Let's re-examine the original premises:\n# InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) - Covered by individual facts\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))) - Kept\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x)) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))) - Kept\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x)) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) - This is a crucial general rule.

The specific rule for Mike makes CPT a *definite* need.\n# To reconcile, we can make the direct premise for Mike the primary driver for his work application needs.\n\n# Revised interpretation: The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" implies a direct consequence for Mike.\n# If we assume Mike has an F1 visa (which is likely given he's an international student in the US), then the general rule also applies.\n# The problem statement is slightly ambiguous on whether the CPT requirement for Mike is *solely* for F1 students or a general requirement for him.\n# To ensure Mike's CPT requirement is met when he wants to work, regardless of his exact visa type (as long as he's a Person and works), we'll keep the direct premise.\n# This premise also makes the CPT option more specific for Mike than the general F1 rule which allows for OPT too.\n# If Mike is an international student in the US, he has F1 or J1. If F1 and works, he needs CPT or OPT.\n# The specific rule for Mike states he needs CPT if he works. This means CPT is a mandatory option for him when working.\n# The original redundant rule \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) is problematic because it forces CPT even if he has a J1 visa, which might not allow CPT.\n# The correct way to interpret \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is as a direct consequence for Mike.\n\n# Let's refine the rules to be more precise:\n# 1. International students in the US have F1 or J1. (Already present)\n# 2. If an international student in the US has an F1 visa and wants to work, they need to apply for CPT OR OPT. (Already present)\n# 3. Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US. This is a specific rule for Mike.\n\n# If Mike is an international student in US and works, he has F1 or J1.\n# If Mike has F1 and works, he needs CPT or OPT.\n# The specific rule for Mike states if he works, he needs CPT. This implies CPT is always necessary for him when working.\n# Therefore, if he has F1 and works, the condition \"NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT())\" is satisfied because NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) is true.\n\n# The current program's premises cover:\n# - Mike is an international student in the US.\n# - Mike wants to work.\n\n# By the first premise:\n# InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2192 F1Visa(mike) \u2228 J1Visa(mike)\n# So, Mike has F1 or J1.\n\n# By the second premise:\n# F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())\n# If Mike has F1 and works, then NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT()).\n\n# By the third premise (specific to Mike):\n# Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n# This is the most direct and specific statement about Mike.\n\n# The original program's third premise:\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# This rule, if applied to Mike (who is an InternationalStudent and US), would imply NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) if Work(mike).\n# This is consistent with the direct statement about Mike. However, it's an overreach if Mike has a J1 visa, as J1 visa holders might not be eligible for CPT.\n# The specific premise about Mike needing CPT if he works is better.\n\n# Let's simplify by removing the problematic general rule and relying on the specific premise for Mike.\n# If Mike has F1, the general rule for F1 holders will apply. If Mike has J1, the specific rule for Mike still applies.\n\n# Simplified Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
