This simplifies the representation when referring to these specific entities.\n5.  **Simplified `Created` rule:** The original `Created(daniShapiro, FamilySecrets(x))` was ambiguous about what `x` represented. It's simplified to `Created(daniShapiro, familySecrets)` assuming `familySecrets` is a specific entity.\n6.  **Made `AmericanCity` explicit:** Added `AmericanCity(boston)` premise to make it explicit that Boston is an American city, which is required for the corrected `BornIn` rule.\n7.  **Simplified first premise:** `\u00ac(Podcast(x) \u2227 Novel(x))` is equivalent to `\u00acPodcast(x) \u2228 \u00acNovel(x)`.\n8.  **Removed redundant `BornIn` premise:** The premise `BornIn(daniShapiro, boston)` combined with `City(boston)` and the new rule `\u2200x \u2200y ((BornIn(x, y) \u2227 City(y) \u2227 AmericanCity(y)) \u2192 American(x))` implies `American(daniShapiro)`.

For a cleaner representation, one might choose to remove it if it becomes redundant. Given the prompt is about fixing bugs and adding edge cases, keeping it can be seen as explicit information.
