Renamed `SixWayTie` to `IsPartOfSixWayTie` to make it more explicit that this predicate applies to an individual being part of such a tie, and thus implicitly on the leaderboard. This addresses the potential ambiguity of `SixWayTie(x)` implying `OnLeaderboard(x, y)` without it being explicitly stated in the premise where it's used.\n# 2. Reverted `Leaderboard` to `OnLeaderboard` to match the original program's choice of predicate name, assuming consistency with the provided context. The original program already consolidated `Leaderboard` into `OnLeaderboard` in its final version.\n# 3. Used more descriptive variable names like `person_in_tie` and `person_belgium` for existential quantifiers for better readability.\n# 4. The logic for \"There was one six-way tie on the leaderboard\" is still interpreted as \"there exists at least one person who is on the leaderboard and is part of a six-way tie\". Representing \"exactly one six-way tie\" would require more complex encoding, which is outside the scope of simplifying existing first-order logic.\n# 5. The premise `\u2203tie (Leaderboard_SixWayTie(tie, 1992duMaurierClassic))` from the *current program* was removed, as `Leaderboard_SixWayTie` was an introduced helper predicate not explicitly defined to be equivalent to the original sentence. The revised premise `\u2203person_in_tie (OnLeaderboard(person_in_tie, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 IsPartOfSixWayTie(person_in_tie))` directly reflects the scenario's statement about a person being in a six-way tie on the leaderboard.\n# 6. The premise `\u2203person (Leaderboard(person, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 SixWayTie(person) \u2227 FromBelgium(person))` from the *current program* was split into two separate premises: one for the six-way tie and one for someone from Belgium being on the leaderboard. This is because the scenario states \"one six-way tie on the leaderboard\" and \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\" separately. The revised premises reflect this more accurately. The premise `\u2203person_belgium (OnLeaderboard(person_belgium, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 FromBelgium(person_belgium))` captures that there is *a* person from Belgium on the leaderboard, and then `FromBelgium(descampe)` and `OnLeaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic)` specifically identify Descampe. The original phrasing \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\" implies that *among* those in the six-way tie, at least one is from Belgium. This is implied if there's a six-way tie AND a person from Belgium on the leaderboard, and we know Descampe fits both. However, a more direct encoding of that specific clause would be `\u2203p (OnLeaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 IsPartOfSixWayTie(p) \u2227 FromBelgium(p))`. For simplicity and to keep the structure close to the provided solution, the current approach relies on identifying Descampe as fulfilling these criteria.\n\n# Revised predicate definitions for clarity within the context of this program:\n# Winner(x, y) ::: x is the winner of event y.\n# Participated(x, y) ::: x participated in event y.\n# OnLeaderboard(x, y) ::: x is on the leaderboard of event y.\n# IsPartOfSixWayTie(x) ::: x is one of the individuals in a six-way tie on the leaderboard.\n# FromBelgium(x) ::: x is from Belgium.\n\n# Conclusion:\nSixWayTie(descampe) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(descampe, duMaurierClassic1992)\n",

Introduced `IsSixWayTie(x)` to represent that `x` is a six-way tie.\n# 2. Introduced `LeaderboardEvent(x, y)` to explicitly state that tie `x` is associated with event `y`. This clarifies the relationship mentioned in the scenario \"one six-way tie on the leaderboard\".\n# 3. Added `\u2200person_in_tie (IsPartOfSixWayTie(person_in_tie) \u2192 FromBelgium(person_in_tie) \u2228 \u00acFromBelgium(person_in_tie))` to represent that for any person in a six-way tie, they are either from Belgium or not from Belgium. This is a tautology and helps in explicit reasoning if needed, though it doesn't add new information.\n# 4. Added `\u2200person_in_tie (IsPartOfSixWayTie(person_in_tie) \u2192 OnLeaderboard(person_in_tie, 1992duMaurierClassic))` to explicitly state that anyone who is part of a six-way tie is also on the leaderboard. This makes the relationship clearer.\n# 5. The premise `\u2203person_belgium (OnLeaderboard(person_belgium, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 FromBelgium(person_belgium))` is still present as it directly maps to \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\", combined with other premises about Descampe and the existence of a six-way tie. The existence of *a* person from Belgium on the leaderboard is a necessary condition.\n\n# Revised predicate definitions for clarity within the context of this program:\n# Winner(x, y) ::: x is the winner of event y.\n# Participated(x, y) ::: x participated in event y.\n# OnLeaderboard(x, y) ::: x is on the leaderboard of event y.\n# IsPartOfSixWayTie(x) ::: x is one of the individuals in a six-way tie on the leaderboard.\n# FromBelgium(x) ::: x is from Belgium.\n# IsSixWayTie(x) ::: x is a six-way tie.\n# LeaderboardEvent(x, y) ::: tie x is on the leaderboard of event y.\n\n# Conclusion:\nSixWayTie(descampe) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(descampe, duMaurierClassic1992)\n",
