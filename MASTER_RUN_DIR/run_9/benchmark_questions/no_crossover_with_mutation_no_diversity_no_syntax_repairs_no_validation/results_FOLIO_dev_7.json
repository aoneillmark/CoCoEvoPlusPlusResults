However, the predicate `OccurIn` usually takes specific entities. For consistency, we'll assume they represent 'all humans' and 'all animals' for the purpose of implication, or that there are specific instances of humans and animals involved. Given the original phrasing, we maintain the existential interpretation of `OccurIn`.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is ambiguous. It could mean a specific type of 'glu' causes tiredness, or 'glu' is a general term for illness. Without further definition of 'glu', it's hard to formalize. We interpret `feelingTired` as a symptom *of* Monkeypox for humans, rather than being caused by an external event like 'glu'.\n# If 'glu' was intended to be a disease that causes tiredness, and Monkeypox itself is a 'glu', the original statement could be rephrased. However, the current phrasing makes `glu` a separate entity.\n# Given the structure of the task, it's likely `glu` was a placeholder for an illness.

The premise `OccurIn(mpv, animals)` is existential.\n# We assume the predicates `Human` and `Person` refer to the same set of entities in this context.\n# The original premise \"\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))\" was problematic as 'g' was not defined or constrained.\n# We've adjusted the `FeelTiredWhen` to be specific to the disease for humans, which is a more direct interpretation of the symptoms.\n# The premise \"OccurIn(mpv, humans)\" implicitly means the virus can occur in at least one human.\n# The premise \"OccurIn(mpv, animals)\" implicitly means the virus can occur in at least one animal.\n# We are keeping the explicit `Monkeypox(mp)` and `MonkeypoxVirus(mpv)` as unique instances for the disease and virus respectively.\n# It is assumed that `fever`, `headache`, `musclePains`, and `feelingTired` are specific instances of symptoms.\n# The original premise `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, g))` implies a cause-effect relation for tiredness, which we have made more specific to the disease context.\n# The predicates `fever`, `headache`, `musclePains`, `feelingTired` are treated as specific symptom instances in relation to Monkeypox.\n# We are assuming that `humans` and `animals` in `OccurIn(mpv, humans)` and `OccurIn(mpv, animals)` are not unique instances but rather categories. However, the predicate `OccurIn` usually takes specific entities. For consistency, we'll assume they represent 'all humans' and 'all animals' for the purpose of implication, or that there are specific instances of humans and animals involved. Given the original phrasing, we maintain the existential interpretation of `OccurIn`.\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" is ambiguous. It could mean a specific type of 'glu' causes tiredness, or 'glu' is a general term for illness. Without further definition of 'glu', it's hard to formalize. We interpret `feelingTired` as a symptom *of* Monkeypox for humans, rather than being caused by an external event like 'glu'.\n# If 'glu' was intended to be a disease that causes tiredness, and Monkeypox itself is a 'glu', the original statement could be rephrased. However, the current phrasing makes `glu` a separate entity.\n# Given the structure of the task, it's likely `glu` was a placeholder for an illness. We have removed it to avoid ambiguity and focus on the core Monkeypox symptom.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",

Monkeypox has symptoms like Fever, Headache, MusclePains, and FeelingTired.\n# 5. People feel tired when they get a Glu.\n# 6. People feel tired when they have symptoms of Monkeypox.\n\n# Let's re-examine original premises for simplification and correctness:\n# - \u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2194 \u2203y SymptomOf(x, y)) : This is problematic.

If MonkeypoxVirus is a *type*, then this should be \u2200x (MonkeypoxVirus(x) \u2192 OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Humans)). Assuming MonkeypoxVirus refers to the specific virus entity.\n# - \u2200x (MonkeypoxVirus(x) \u2192 OccurIn(x, Animals)) : Similar to above.\n# - \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 InfectiousDisease(x)) : Redundant if InfectiousDisease(Monkeypox) is present.\n# - \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 CausedBy(x, MonkeypoxVirus)) : Redundant if CausedBy(Monkeypox, MonkeypoxVirus) is present.\n# - \u2200x (Fever(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(x, Monkeypox)) : Good.\n# - \u2200x (Headache(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(x, Monkeypox)) : Good.\n# - \u2200x (MusclePains(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(x, Monkeypox)) : Good.\n# - \u2200x (FeelingTired(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(x, Monkeypox)) : Good.\n# - \u2200x \u2200y (Person(x) \u2227 SymptomOf(y, Monkeypox) \u2227 FeelingTired(y) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Monkeypox)) : This is complex.
