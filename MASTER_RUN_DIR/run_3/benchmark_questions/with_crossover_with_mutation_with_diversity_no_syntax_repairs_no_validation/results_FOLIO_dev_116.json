However, \"x can block y's shooting\" is a more common interpretation for `Block(x, y)`.\n#    The current interpretation assumes `Block(x, y)` means \"x can block the shooting *action* of person y\".\n# 2. The existence of `Shooter(x)` and `GreatShooter(x)` predicates suggests there might be a question about who is a great shooter.\n# 3. The `Class(x)` predicate was also omitted. The statement \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class\"\n#    is descriptive of Michael. Without knowing who else is in his class, or what it means for someone to be in his class,\n#    this fact doesn't directly yield inferential rules. We rely on explicit `Taller` relations.\n# 4. The rule \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting\" is partially superseded by\n#    the specific rule for Michael. The current rules prioritize the specific conditions for blocking.\n#    If we were to include it, it would be: `Man(x) & Taller(x, y) => Block(x, y)`. However, this might lead to contradictions\n#    or ambiguities with Michael's specific blocking rules. The current formulation focuses on what is *explicitly* stated as enabling blocking.\n\n# Let's add the interpretation of the first blocking rule more formally if it's to be used:\n# Original: \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# This could mean: `Man(x) & Taller(x, y) => Block(x, y)`.\n# However, Michael's rule is `ForAll y, (Person(y) & ~Jump(y)) => Block(michael, y)`.\n# If Peter is taller than Michael (`Taller(peter, michael)`), and Peter is a Man, then `Man(peter) & Taller(peter, michael) => Block(peter, michael)`.\n# This doesn't create a direct conflict with Michael's abilities.\n# The problem is that the first rule is very general.\n# Given the explicit rule for Michael and the fact that he *cannot* block Windy, it's safer to rely on specific blocking conditions.\n# The provided context does not give enough information to establish `Shooter(x)` for any individual, nor `Jump(x)` or `GreatShooter(x)`.\n# The problem is to encode the scenario, not to answer a question about it.\n\n# Simplified Premises (focusing on directly inferable blocking capabilities):\n# Individuals and their basic types\nmichael: person\npeter: person\nwindy: person\n\nMan(michael)\nMan(peter)\nMan(windy)\nPerson(michael)\nPerson(peter)\nPerson(windy)\n\n# Height relations\nTaller(peter, michael)\n\n# Transitivity of Taller\nTaller(x, y) & Taller(y, z) => Taller(x, z)\n\n# Blocking capabilities\n# Michael can block the shooting of any person `p` if `p` does not jump.\nForAll p, (Person(p) & ~Jump(p)) => Block(michael, p)\n\n# Specific exception for Michael\n~Block(michael, windy)\n\n# Great Shooter definition\nShooter(x) & Jump(x) => GreatShooter(x)\n\n# Note: The predicate `Shooting(y)` from the original problem description has been omitted as it seems to represent an event\n# and is not directly utilized in the rules for blocking or shooting abilities, assuming `Block(x, y)` means \"x can block y's shooting\".\n# The predicate `Class(x)` is also omitted as its role in deriving logical implications is unclear without further information on class membership.\n# The initial rule \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting\" is not explicitly added as a premise\n# because the problem provides a more specific rule for Michael's blocking, and the context does not give enough information\n# to apply this general rule to other individuals or to resolve potential conflicts.

Without knowing who else is in his class, or what it means for someone to be in his class,\n#    this fact doesn't directly yield inferential rules. We rely on explicit `Taller` relations.\n# 4. The rule \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting\" is partially superseded by\n#    the specific rule for Michael. The current rules prioritize the specific conditions for blocking.\n#    If we were to include it, it would be: `Man(x) & Taller(x, y) => Block(x, y)`. However, this might lead to contradictions\n#    or ambiguities with Michael's specific blocking rules. The current formulation focuses on what is *explicitly* stated as enabling blocking.\n\n# Let's add the interpretation of the first blocking rule more formally if it's to be used:\n# Original: \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# This could mean: `Man(x) & Taller(x, y) => Block(x, y)`.\n# However, Michael's rule is `ForAll y, (Person(y) & ~Jump(y)) => Block(michael, y)`.\n# If Peter is taller than Michael (`Taller(peter, michael)`), and Peter is a Man, then `Man(peter) & Taller(peter, michael) => Block(peter, michael)`.\n# This doesn't create a direct conflict with Michael's abilities.\n# The problem is that the first rule is very general.\n# Given the explicit rule for Michael and the fact that he *cannot* block Windy, it's safer to rely on specific blocking conditions.\n# The provided context does not give enough information to establish `Shooter(x)` for any individual, nor `Jump(x)` or `GreatShooter(x)`.\n# The problem is to encode the scenario, not to answer a question about it.\n\n# Simplified Premises (focusing on directly inferable blocking capabilities):\n# Individuals and their basic types\nmichael: person\npeter: person\nwindy: person\n\nMan(michael)\nMan(peter)\nMan(windy)\nPerson(michael)\nPerson(peter)\nPerson(windy)\n\n# Height relations\nTaller(peter, michael)\n\n# Transitivity of Taller\nTaller(x, y) & Taller(y, z) => Taller(x, z)\n\n# Blocking capabilities\n# Michael can block the shooting of any person `p` if `p` does not jump.\nForAll p, (Person(p) & ~Jump(p)) => Block(michael, p)\n\n# Specific exception for Michael\n~Block(michael, windy)\n\n# Great Shooter definition\nShooter(x) & Jump(x) => GreatShooter(x)\n\n# Note: The predicate `Shooting(y)` from the original problem description has been omitted as it seems to represent an event\n# and is not directly utilized in the rules for blocking or shooting abilities, assuming `Block(x, y)` means \"x can block y's shooting\".\n# The predicate `Class(x)` is also omitted as its role in deriving logical implications is unclear without further information on class membership.\n# The initial rule \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting\" is not explicitly added as a premise\n# because the problem provides a more specific rule for Michael's blocking, and the context does not give enough information\n# to apply this general rule to other individuals or to resolve potential conflicts. The focus is on directly inferable capabilities.\n\n# Conclusion:\nBlock(peter, windy)\n",
