If 'glu'\n# were to be a specific disease, then `Glu(x)` would be `IsADisease(x)` and\n# the rule would be `Person(p) \u2227 IsADisease(d) \u2227 Contracts(p, d) \u2192 ExperiencesTiredness(p)`.\n# However, sticking to the provided predicates, `Glu(x)` is a distinct type.\n\n# Simplification: The predicates `Human(human)`, `Mammal(mammal)`, `Animal(animal)` in the original\n# program were likely intended to represent types rather than instances.\n# The current program uses `Human(x)`, `Mammal(x)`, `Animal(x)` as predicates applicable to any entity `x`.\n# This is a more robust FOL approach. For example, `Human(john)` means John is a human.\n# The premise `CanOccurIn(monkeypox_virus, human)` now means the virus can occur in the *category* of humans.\n# This allows reasoning about individual humans if we have `Human(i)`.\n# If `Human(i)` and `CanOccurIn(monkeypox_virus, i)` is true, then the virus can occur in `i`.\n# The existing premises like `Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x)` already support this general reasoning.\n\n# Clarification on `FeelTiredWhen`:\n# The original `Person(p) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` with `Glu(g)` implies that for any person `p` and any `g` that is a `Glu`,\n# `p` feels tired when they get `g`. We have made `glu_condition` an instance of `Glu`.\n# The premise `Person(p) \u2192 ExperiencesTirednessWhen(p, glu_condition)` asserts this for `glu_condition`.\n# This is a direct interpretation.\n# If the intention was that *any* glu causes tiredness, then `Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 ExperiencesTirednessWhen(p, g)` would be more appropriate.\n# For consistency with the given predicate `Glu(x)` and the simplified structure, we use the former.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (Human(x) \u2227 Glu(x))\n",

If 'glu'\n# were to be a specific disease, then `Glu(x)` would be `IsADisease(x)` and\n# the rule would be `Person(p) \u2227 IsADisease(d) \u2227 Contracts(p, d) \u2192 ExperiencesTiredness(p)`.\n# However, sticking to the provided predicates, `Glu(x)` is a distinct type.\n\n# Simplification: The predicates `Human(human)`, `Mammal(mammal)`, `Animal(animal)` in the original\n# program were likely intended to represent types rather than instances.\n# The current program uses `Human(x)`, `Mammal(x)`, `Animal(x)` as predicates applicable to any entity `x`.\n# This is a more robust FOL approach. For example, `Human(john)` means John is a human.\n# The premise `CanOccurIn(monkeypox_virus, human)` now means the virus can occur in the *category* of humans.\n# This allows reasoning about individual humans if we have `Human(i)`.\n# If `Human(i)` and `CanOccurIn(monkeypox_virus, i)` is true, then the virus can occur in `i`.\n# The existing premises like `Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x)` already support this general reasoning.\n\n# Clarification on `FeelTiredWhen`:\n# The original `Person(p) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` with `Glu(g)` implies that for any person `p` and any `g` that is a `Glu`,\n# `p` feels tired when they get `g`. We have made `glu_condition` an instance of `Glu`.\n# The premise `Person(p) \u2192 ExperiencesTirednessWhen(p, glu_condition)` asserts this for `glu_condition`.\n# This is a direct interpretation.\n# If the intention was that *any* glu causes tiredness, then `Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 ExperiencesTirednessWhen(p, g)` would be more appropriate.\n# For consistency with the given predicate `Glu(x)` and the simplified structure, we use the former.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",
