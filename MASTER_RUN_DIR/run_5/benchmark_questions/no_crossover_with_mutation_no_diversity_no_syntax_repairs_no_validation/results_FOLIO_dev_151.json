The \"into English\" part is implicitly handled by the second premise which states all books published by New Vessel Press are in English.\n- The predicate `ForeignLiterature` was changed to be a type of literature rather than a property of literature itself. This is reflected in `Specializes(newVesselPress, ForeignLiterature)`.\n- The premise \"Neapolitan Chronicles is Italian\" was changed to `Italian(Italian)`. This is a more accurate representation as \"Italian\" refers to the language, not the book itself being Italian in origin. The translation is from the Italian language.\n- The premise `Italian(neapolitanChronicles)` was removed because it was redundant and potentially misleading. The book `neapolitanChronicles` is not Italian, it is translated *from* Italian. The fact that Italian is a language is now explicitly stated with `Italian(Italian)`.\n- The predicate `Name(x, y)` was not used in the original premises and has been removed as it was not necessary for the given scenario.\n\n# Conclusion:\nPublishedBy(harryPotter, newVesselPress)\n",

The \"into English\" part is implicitly handled by the second premise which states all books published by New Vessel Press are in English.\n- The predicate `ForeignLiterature` was changed to be a type of literature rather than a property of literature itself. This is reflected in `Specializes(newVesselPress, ForeignLiterature)`.\n- The premise \"Neapolitan Chronicles is Italian\" was changed to `Italian(Italian)`. This is a more accurate representation as \"Italian\" refers to the language, not the book itself being Italian in origin. The translation is from the Italian language.\n- The premise `Italian(neapolitanChronicles)` was removed because it was redundant and potentially misleading. The book `neapolitanChronicles` is not Italian, it is translated *from* Italian. The fact that Italian is a language is now explicitly stated with `Italian(Italian)`.\n- The predicate `Name(x, y)` was not used in the original premises and has been removed as it was not necessary for the given scenario.\n\n# Conclusion:\nTranslatedFrom(palaceOfFlies, italian)\n",
