It implies that *any* international student in the US who wants to work must apply for CPT, regardless of visa type.\n# This might contradict or simplify the F1 rule. If Mike has F1, then Rule 2 says he needs CPT *or* OPT.\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" suggests CPT is always required for Mike.\n# This implies that the CPT application is mandatory for Mike if he wants to work.\n# Let's consider the case where Mike has an F1 visa.\n# If Mike has F1 and wants to work, Rule 2 says NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT()).\n# The scenario states Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work. This implies NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) is a requirement.\n# This means CPT is a *sufficient* requirement for Mike to work, or the statement is stronger and implies CPT is *necessary*.\n# Assuming the statement implies CPT is a necessary step for Mike to work:\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) is consistent with this.\n# This rule would mean that even if Mike had a J1, he would still need to apply for CPT to work. This might be an unintended consequence.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the intent.\n# \"International students in US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\" - Covered.\n# \"An international student in US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.\" - Covered.\n# \"Mike is an international student.\" - Covered.\n# \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\"\n\n# The critical part is how \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" relates to his visa status.\n# If Mike has F1: Rule 2 applies (CPT or OPT). The statement about Mike needing CPT implies CPT is a valid path.\n# If Mike has J1: The scenario doesn't explicitly state what J1 students need to do to work, other than the very general rule in the original program:\n# \u2200x (Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()) \u2228 J1Visa(x))\n# This last rule in the original program is quite loose. It states that if someone works, they must either apply for CPT/OPT OR have a J1 visa.\n# This is also confusing. It implies that having a J1 visa might be an *alternative* to applying for CPT/OPT for working, which is not how visas and work permits typically function.\n\n# Let's simplify and focus on the direct statements.\n# We know:\n# 1. Mike is an international student in the US.\n# 2. If an international student in the US wants to work AND has an F1 visa, they need CPT or OPT.\n# 3. Mike needs CPT if he wants to work.\n\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" should take precedence for Mike.\n# It's a direct requirement for Mike.\n\n# Let's assume the original last rule:\n# \u2200x (Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()) \u2228 J1Visa(x))\n# is intended to cover cases where we don't know the F1 status, or for J1 students.\n# However, the scenario doesn't provide specific rules for J1 students wanting to work.\n\n# A cleaner approach:\n# Focus on what is explicitly stated and simplify redundant/confusing rules.\n\n# The original premises:\n# Person(mike)\n# InternationalStudent(mike)\n# US(mike)\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))  -- Covered.\n\n# \u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))) -- Covered.\n\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT())) -- This rule makes CPT mandatory for *any* international student in US who wants to work. This might be too strong and override the F1/OPT choice if Mike has F1.\n\n# \u2200x (Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()) \u2228 J1Visa(x)) -- This is confusing and likely not intended to mean J1 is an alternative to CPT/OPT *application*. It's usually a visa type that *enables* work, possibly with its own authorization process.\n\n# Let's refine based on common understanding of these terms.\n# If you have F1 and want to work, you need CPT *or* OPT.\n# If you have J1 and want to work, you likely need a separate work authorization under the J1 program. The scenario does not provide details for J1 work.\n\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" is a specific constraint for Mike.\n# This implies that if Mike works, CPT is a required action for him.\n\n# Let's redefine the rules to avoid ambiguity and ensure they capture the specific scenario for Mike.\n\n# Revised Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
