distinction between residential colleges, graduate school, and professional schools is implicit in the original.\n# The new program could make this more explicit IF we introduce new predicates.\n# But given the instruction to \"keep the same format\" and \"generally keep the same vocabulary\",\n# we should avoid introducing radically new predicates unless absolutely necessary for clarity or to fix bugs.\n\n# The most significant change is the predicate naming convention, making it more expressive.\n# `IsConstituentOf(x, y)` is clearer than `Organized(x, y)` combined with `College(x)`.\n# `ConstituentName(x, y)` is a direct replacement for `Name(x, y)` when applied to constituents.\n\n# Let's represent the 12 professional schools explicitly with distinct variables.\n# This makes the facts more concrete, even if the names aren't provided.\n# This is a standard way to handle distinct objects in logic when their specific identities are known but names aren't.\n\n# We need to ensure these are *distinct* from the other constituents and from each other.\n# In a formal system, this would be done via unique names or explicit distinctness axioms.\n# Here, we use different variable

variables if the logic system handles it.\n# Or we can use a quantified statement to express their existence and count.\n# However, the prompt asks to keep the same format, which implies explicit facts.\n# We will represent them using distinct variables as in the original but with new predicate names.\n# This is a subtle change but fulfills the \"different program\" requirement.\n\n# Let's assume the existence of 12 distinct professional schools (e.g., ps1 to ps12).\n# This is an explicit representation of the 12 professional schools.\n\n# ps1, ps2, ps3, ps4, ps5, ps6, ps7, ps8, ps9, ps10, ps11, ps12 are implicitly defined as unique entities.\n# We need to assert they are constituents of Yale.\n# And that they are professional schools.\n# The original prompt did not have a predicate for \"ProfessionalSchool\".\n# We can introduce one or infer it. Let's infer it by naming convention if not introducing new types of predicates beyond what's implied by the prompt's structure.\n# The original prompt's predicates: University, Private, IvyLeague, Research, Location, Year, EndowmentValue, Organized, College, Name.\n# The new program should aim for simplicity and fixing potential issues.\n\n# Let's stick to predicates that can be derived or are very close to the original.\n# The original had `College(x)` and `Name(x, y)`.\n# The new program uses `IsConstituentOf(x, y)` and `ConstituentName(x, y)`.\n# This is a structural difference.\n\n# To add missing edge cases or simplify logic:\n# The original `\u2203y (Location(yaleUniversity, newHaven) \u2227 Year(y) \u2227 y = 1716)` is a bit convoluted.\n# `MovedInYear(yaleUniversity, 1716)` is simpler and more direct.\n# `Location(yaleUniversity, newHaven)` is also more direct than `\u2203y (Location(yaleUniversity, newHaven) ...)` where `y` wasn't used for anything else.\n\n# The distinction between residential colleges, graduate school, and professional schools is implicit in the original.\n# The new program could make this more explicit IF we introduce new predicates.\n# But given the instruction to \"keep the same format\" and \"generally keep the same vocabulary\",\n# we should avoid introducing radically new predicates unless absolutely necessary for clarity or to fix bugs.\n\n# The most significant change is the predicate naming convention, making it more expressive.\n# `IsConstituentOf(x, y)` is clearer than `Organized(x, y)` combined with `College(x)`.\n# `ConstituentName(x, y)` is a direct replacement for `Name(x, y)` when applied to constituents.\n\n# Let's represent the 12 professional schools explicitly with distinct variables.\n# This makes the facts more concrete, even if the names aren't provided.\n# This is a standard way to handle distinct objects in logic when their specific identities are known but names aren't.\n\n# We need to ensure these are *distinct* from the other constituents and from each other.\n# In a formal system, this would be done via unique names or explicit distinctness axioms.\n# Here, we use different variable names (ps1, ps2, etc.) as a convention for distinctness.\n\n# Premises:\n# Yale University

We introduce a new predicate CollegeOrSchool(x) to cover this.\n# The previous program had College(x) and IsCollegeOrSchool(x).\n# To simplify, we assume ResidentialCollege implies CollegeOrSchool, and OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool implies CollegeOrSchool.\n\n# The previous program defined College(x) and ResidentialCollege(x) and then had ResidentialCollege(x) -> College(x).\n# This implies all residential colleges are also just generally \"colleges\".\n# We can simplify by having a general predicate `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)`\n# and then specific types like `ResidentialCollege(x)` and `ProfessionalSchool(x)`.\n# For this task, we will stick closer to the original vocabulary but clarify the intent.\n# We will use `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` to denote any entity that is part of the university's organization.\n\nConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x) :- ResidentialCollege(x).\nConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x) :- OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x).\n\n# The text mentions \"27 constituent colleges and schools\".\n# We will define a new predicate `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` which is true for all listed colleges and schools.\n# The previous definition of `Organized(x, y)` where y is a number is a bit unusual.\n# We are replacing it with `NumberOfConstituentCollegesAndSchools(x, y)` for clarity.\n\n# The previous program had `College(x) ::: x is a constituent college or school.`\n# This is now represented by `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)`.\n# We are also explicitly naming all the listed colleges and schools.\n# The previous program also used `College(x)` for residential colleges and then listed them.\n# It is cleaner to have a dedicated predicate `ResidentialCollege(x)` and then assert `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` for them.\n# The professional schools were listed with `IsCollegeOrSchool(x)`. We will use `OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` for those not explicitly named as residential colleges.\n\n# Missing edge-case: The list of professional schools was not exhaustive in the original text.\n# We are adding explicit entries for the schools mentioned.\n# The original text mentions \"27 constituent colleges and schools\" and lists 14 residential colleges.\n# This implies there are 27 - 14 = 13 other constituent colleges and schools.\n# The provided list has 12 professional schools.\n# The Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also a constituent part, and not typically classified as a \"professional school\" in the same vein.\n# We are assuming the \"27 constituent colleges and schools\" refers to the sum of residential colleges, the graduate school, and the professional schools listed.\n# The previous code used `College(x)` for residential colleges and `IsCollegeOrSchool(x)` for others. This is ambiguous.\n# We are introducing `ResidentialCollege(x)` and `OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` to be more precise.\n# And then a general `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` that subsumes both.\n\n# Simplification: Redundant predicates like `College(x)` when `ResidentialCollege(x)` already exists and implies it is simplified.\n# We are making the predicates more specific to avoid ambiguity.\n# For example, `Year(x)` in the context of `Year(1716)` was ambiguous. `YearMoved(yaleUniversity, 1716)` is more precise.\n# Similarly, `EndowmentValue(yaleUniversity, 42.3billion)` is clearer than just `EndowmentValue(x, y)`.\n\n# The predicate `ConstituentOf(x, y)` is kept as it is clear and useful.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (University(x) \u2227 EndowmentValue(x, y) \u2227 y > 42300000000)\n",

We introduce a new predicate CollegeOrSchool(x) to cover this.\n# The previous program had College(x) and IsCollegeOrSchool(x).\n# To simplify, we assume ResidentialCollege implies CollegeOrSchool, and OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool implies CollegeOrSchool.\n\n# The previous program defined College(x) and ResidentialCollege(x) and then had ResidentialCollege(x) -> College(x).\n# This implies all residential colleges are also just generally \"colleges\".\n# We can simplify by having a general predicate `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)`\n# and then specific types like `ResidentialCollege(x)` and `ProfessionalSchool(x)`.\n# For this task, we will stick closer to the original vocabulary but clarify the intent.\n# We will use `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` to denote any entity that is part of the university's organization.\n\nConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x) :- ResidentialCollege(x).\nConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x) :- OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x).\n\n# The text mentions \"27 constituent colleges and schools\".\n# We will define a new predicate `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` which is true for all listed colleges and schools.\n# The previous definition of `Organized(x, y)` where y is a number is a bit unusual.\n# We are replacing it with `NumberOfConstituentCollegesAndSchools(x, y)` for clarity.\n\n# The previous program had `College(x) ::: x is a constituent college or school.`\n# This is now represented by `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)`.\n# We are also explicitly naming all the listed colleges and schools.\n# The previous program also used `College(x)` for residential colleges and then listed them.\n# It is cleaner to have a dedicated predicate `ResidentialCollege(x)` and then assert `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` for them.\n# The professional schools were listed with `IsCollegeOrSchool(x)`. We will use `OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` for those not explicitly named as residential colleges.\n\n# Missing edge-case: The list of professional schools was not exhaustive in the original text.\n# We are adding explicit entries for the schools mentioned.\n# The original text mentions \"27 constituent colleges and schools\" and lists 14 residential colleges.\n# This implies there are 27 - 14 = 13 other constituent colleges and schools.\n# The provided list has 12 professional schools.\n# The Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also a constituent part, and not typically classified as a \"professional school\" in the same vein.\n# We are assuming the \"27 constituent colleges and schools\" refers to the sum of residential colleges, the graduate school, and the professional schools listed.\n# The previous code used `College(x)` for residential colleges and `IsCollegeOrSchool(x)` for others. This is ambiguous.\n# We are introducing `ResidentialCollege(x)` and `OtherConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` to be more precise.\n# And then a general `ConstituentCollegeOrSchool(x)` that subsumes both.\n\n# Simplification: Redundant predicates like `College(x)` when `ResidentialCollege(x)` already exists and implies it is simplified.\n# We are making the predicates more specific to avoid ambiguity.\n# For example, `Year(x)` in the context of `Year(1716)` was ambiguous. `YearMoved(yaleUniversity, 1716)` is more precise.\n# Similarly, `EndowmentValue(yaleUniversity, 42.3billion)` is clearer than just `EndowmentValue(x, y)`.\n\n# The predicate `ConstituentOf(x, y)` is kept as it is clear and useful.\n\n# Conclusion:\nConstituent(piersonCollege, yale) \u2227 PartOf(piersonCollege, residentialColleges)\n",
