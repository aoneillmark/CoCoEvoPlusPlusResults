it could mean \"is a university college\" generally,\n# or \"is a constituent college of Yale.\" The revised approach clarifies this.\n# The premise `College(x) \u2227 Organized(yale, x)` for all residential colleges was problematic.\n# `College(x)` as a general predicate might apply to other universities.\n# `Organized(yale, x)` implies `x` is a part of `yale`.\n# The new `IsConstituentOf(x, yale)` precisely captures that `x` is a part of `yale`.\n# The existence of the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools\n# is implicitly covered by the `OrganizedIntoConstituentCount(yale, 27)` and the fact that\n# the named residential colleges are accounted for.\n# If we were to explicitly represent them, we would need to assert their constituency.\n# For example:\n# IsConstituentOf(yaleGraduateSchoolOfArtsAndSciences, yale)\n# IsConstituentOf(professionalSchool1, yale) ... and so on.\n# However, given the provided names, we only have explicit names for the residential colleges.\n# The original code did not name the graduate school or professional schools either.\n# The simplification comes from the explicit `IsConstituentOf` predicate.\n\n# Final check on predicates and premises for consistency and completeness based on the scenario:\n# - University, Private, IvyLeague, Research: Covered.\n# - Location, Year, MovedTo: Covered.\n# - EndowmentValue: Covered.\n# - OrganizedIntoConstituentCount: Replaces Organized(yale, 27) and handles the count.\n# - CollegeOrSchool: Replaced by IsConstituentOf(x, yale) which is more specific.\n# - Name: Covered.\n# - ResidentialCollege: Added to distinguish from other types of constituents, as per the scenario.\n# - IsConstituentOf(x, y): New, more direct predicate for part-whole relationships.\n\n# The original code implicitly assumed that all listed items were colleges/schools.\n# The new code explicitly states they are constituents of Yale, which is a stronger statement.\n# The use of `ResidentialCollege(x)` predicate further refines the types of constituents.\n# This makes the encoding more precise and easier to reason about.\n\n# Conclusion:\nConstituent(piersonCollege, yale) \u2227 PartOf(piersonCollege, residentialColleges)\n",
