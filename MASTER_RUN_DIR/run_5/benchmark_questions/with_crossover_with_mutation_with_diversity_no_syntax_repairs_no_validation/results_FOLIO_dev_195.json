There exists a set of 6 people, who are tied for some position on the leaderboard.\n# 2. At least one person in this set of 6 is from Belgium.\n\n# Let's refine the tie group definition slightly to be more explicit about members being on the leaderboard.\n# This is already implicit in `TieOnLeaderboard(tie_group, 1992duMaurierClassic)` if we define `TieOnLeaderboard` to mean \"set of people on leaderboard in a tie\".\n\n# The initial premises about Steinhauer are retained as they are factual statements.\n# The logic for the tie is the main area of improvement for clarity and avoiding redundancy.\n# The original formulation for the six-way tie was extremely verbose.\n\n# Let's ensure that if Descampe is from Belgium and on the leaderboard, that fact is utilized directly.\n# The original program implies that Descampe being from Belgium and on the leaderboard is a separate fact from the existence of a tie and a Belgian in that tie.\n\n# Revised premises to directly use Descampe in relation to the tie if possible, or acknowledge the independence.\n# The statement \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\" is existential.\n# We know Descampe is from Belgium and on the leaderboard.\n# It's possible Descampe is part of the six-way tie, or not.\n# The most robust way is to state the existence of the tie group and a Belgian in it, independently of Descampe's specific tie status.\n\n# The initial set of premises are retained. The main change is the representation of the six-way tie.\n# The predicate `SixWayTie(x)` was interpreted as \"x is in a situation of a six-way tie\".\n# The current approach using a `tie_group` is more structured.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the original problem's phrasing: \"There was one six-way tie on the leaderboard and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium.\"\n# This implies:\n# 1. \u2203tie_event ( SixWayTie(tie_event) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(tie_event, 1992duMaurierClassic) ) -- This interpretation of SixWayTie was problematic.\n# Let's assume \"six-way tie\" refers to a set of people.\n# So, \u2203tie_group ( SetOfSixPeople(tie_group) \u2227 AllInTieGroupOnLeaderboard(tie_group, 1992duMaurierClassic) )\n# AND \u2203person ( MemberOf(person, tie_group) \u2227 FromBelgium(person) )\n\n# The proposed solution with `TieOnLeaderboard` and `MemberOfTie` captures this.\n# The distinctness assertions for p1 to p6 correctly establish a group of at least six distinct individuals.\n# The premise `\u2200x (OnLeaderboard(x, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2192 Participated(x, 1992duMaurierClassic))` is crucial and kept.\n\n# The most significant simplification is replacing the verbose existential quantification of 6 individuals directly with a set-based approach and explicit distinctness checks.\n\n# Removing redundant predicates and logic:\n# The predicates `SixWayTie(x)` and `Leaderboard(x, y)` (which `OnLeaderboard` superseded) are less useful than the structured approach.\n# The predicate `OnLeaderboard(x, y)` is kept as it's directly used.\n# The premise `\u2203x (FromBelgium(x) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(x, 1992duMaurierClassic))` is redundant given `OnLeaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic)` and `FromBelgium(descampe)`.\n\n# Cleaned up premises:\nWinner(steinhauer, 1992duMaurierClassic).\nParticipated(steinhauer, 1992duMaurierClassic).\nFromBelgium(descampe).\nOnLeaderboard(descampe, 1992duMaurierClassic).\n\u2200x (OnLeaderboard(x, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2192 Participated(x, 1992duMaurierClassic)).\n\n# Defining TieOnLeaderboard and MemberOfTie implicitly in the premise for clarity.\n# A six-way tie implies a group of six individuals, all on the leaderboard, in a tie.\n# One person in that tie group is from Belgium.\n\u2203tie_group (\n    # This tie group consists of six distinct participants.\n    \u2203p1 (MemberOfTie(p1, tie_group) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(p1, 1992duMaurierClassic)) /\\\n    \u2203p2 (MemberOfTie(p2, tie_group) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(p2, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 \u00ac(p1 = p2)) /\\\n    \u2203p3 (MemberOfTie(p3, tie_group) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(p3, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 \u00ac(p1 = p3) \u2227 \u00ac(p2 = p3)) /\\\n    \u2203p4 (MemberOfTie(p4, tie_group) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(p4, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 \u00ac(p1 = p4) \u2227 \u00ac(p2 = p4) \u2227 \u00ac(p3 = p4)) /\\\n    \u2203p5 (MemberOfTie(p5, tie_group) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(p5, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 \u00ac(p1 = p5) \u2227 \u00ac(p2 = p5) \u2227 \u00ac(p3 = p5) \u2227 \u00ac(p4 = p5)) /\\\n    \u2203p6 (MemberOfTie(p6, tie_group) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(p6, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2227 \u00ac(p1 = p6) \u2227 \u00ac(p2 = p6) \u2227 \u00ac(p3 = p6) \u2227 \u00ac(p4 = p6) \u2227 \u00ac(p5 = p6)) /\\\n    # And at least one member of this tie group is from Belgium.\n    \u2203p_belgium (MemberOfTie(p_belgium, tie_group) \u2227 FromBelgium(p_belgium))\n).\n# Note: The predicate `TieOnLeaderboard` is not explicitly defined as a standalone predicate but its properties (group of 6, on leaderboard, in a tie) are directly asserted in the premise. `MemberOfTie` is also implicitly defined by this structure.
