The original premise `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` directly states Mike's requirement.\n# 2. The premise `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))`\n#    also applies to Mike due to his F1 visa.\n# 3. By stating `F1Visa(mike)`, the general rule for F1 visa holders applies.\n# 4. The direct statement about Mike needing CPT if he works is the most specific and crucial rule for him.\n# 5. The current premises capture all these facts. The redundancy is that if Mike needs CPT (from rule 6), then needing CPT OR OPT (from rule 5) is a weaker conclusion that is still satisfied.\n# 6. To simplify, we could potentially remove the rule about F1 visa holders needing CPT or OPT if the intent is solely to focus on what Mike *must* do, and that the direct rule for him is paramount.\n#    However, to maintain the overall scenario's rules, it's better to keep both and ensure consistency.\n\n# The most significant \"bug fix\" or simplification would be to ensure that the specific rule for Mike is prioritized or clearly stated.\n# The original set had two rules that could apply to Mike's work situation.\n# The rule: \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# directly encodes \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\"\n# This rule is more direct than the F1 visa specific rule.\n# The current set is logically consistent. The simplification is achieved by ensuring the most direct rule for Mike is present and clearly stated.\n\n# Let's ensure all premises are essential and not truly redundant in a way that hides logical errors.\n# Premises 1, 2, 3: Facts about Mike.\n# Premise 4: General visa rule for IS in US. Necessary to establish the visa landscape.\n# Premise 5: General rule for F1 visa holders. Necessary as Mike has an F1.\n# Premise 6: General rule for IS in US wanting to work. This directly encodes the specific statement about Mike.\n\n# The prompt states \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\"\n# This can be interpreted as a conditional fact about Mike.\n# The original formulation included `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))`.\n# This rule, when instantiated for 'mike', becomes `InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`.\n# Since `InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike)` and `Work(mike)` are given as facts, this directly implies `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`.\n\n# The other rule for F1 visa holders: `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))`.\n# For Mike: `InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 F1Visa(mike) \u2227 Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT())`.\n# This also implies `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT())`.\n\n# The original set of premises implies that Mike needs CPT (from rule 6), AND Mike needs CPT or OPT (from rule 5).\n# This is logically sound. The problem is not a bug in entailment but potentially in how the specific rule for Mike is represented.\n\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is directly captured by the original rule 6.\n# Therefore, the set of premises is largely correct.
