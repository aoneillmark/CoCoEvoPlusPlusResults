The intention of the original rule seems to be that if you are born in `y` and `y` is a city and `y` is an American city, then you are American.\n# The provided facts `City(boston)` and `AmericanCity(boston)` already establish `boston` as an American city.\n# Therefore, the premise `\u00acCity(y) \u2228 AmericanCity(y)` is implicitly handled by specifying `AmericanCity(boston)`.\n# The most direct translation of \"If a person is born in American City, the person is American\" is:\n# `\u00acBornIn(x, city) \u2228 AmericanCity(city) \u2228 American(x)`.\n# However, given the explicit fact `AmericanCity(boston)`, the simplified rule `\u00acBornIn(x, y) \u2228 \u00acCity(y) \u2228 American(x)`\n# along with the premise `AmericanCity(boston)` achieves the same result for the given scenario.\n# The original rule `\u00acBornIn(x, y) \u2228 \u00acCity(y) \u2228 \u00acAmericanCity(y) \u2228 American(x)` would require `AmericanCity(y)` to be true for `y` to be an American City,\n# and it seems `AmericanCity` is a property of cities.\n# The premise `AmericanCity(boston)` in the current code is more like a fact that Boston is an American city.\n# The rule should probably be: `\u00acBornIn(x, city) \u2228 IsAmericanCity(city) \u2228 American(x)`.\n# And then have `IsAmericanCity(boston)`.\n# For this revision, we stick to the spirit of the provided predicates, and assume `AmericanCity(y)` is a direct property.\n# The premise `AmericanCity(boston)` in the original code is sufficient to make `daniShapiro` American if born in `boston`.\n\n# NovelWriter(daniShapiro) was present in the original program, but it is derivable from the rules:\n# Person(daniShapiro), WrittenBy(familyHistory, daniShapiro), Novel(familyHistory), and \u00acNovel(x) \u2228 \u00acWrittenBy(x, y) \u2228 \u00acPerson(y) \u2228 NovelWriter(y).\n# Therefore, it's removed as redundant.\n\n# Conclusion:\nBornIn(daniShapiro, boston)\n",
