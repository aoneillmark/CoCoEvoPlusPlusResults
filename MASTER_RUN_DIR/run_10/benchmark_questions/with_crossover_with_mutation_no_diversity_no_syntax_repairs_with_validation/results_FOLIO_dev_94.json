So the deposit is either $2000 or more than $2000.\n# The scenario also explicitly states \"2000$ is more than $1500\".\n# To make the Tom's renting condition below fully evaluable for Olive Garden,\n# we need a premise that specifies the deposit amount for Olive Garden.\n# Based on the context \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\",\n# and \"The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.\",\n# the deposit for Olive Garden must be >= $2000.\n# Since 2000 is NOT <= 1500, Tom will NOT rent at Olive Garden if Fluffy is not allowed.\n# If Fluffy is allowed, Tom still will not rent because the deposit > $1500.\n# Let's add a premise for Olive Garden's deposit to be concrete, but adhering to the rule.\n# For example, DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2500) would satisfy >= 2000.\n# Or, DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) would satisfy == 2000.\n# The problem statement doesn't *force* a specific amount, but for logic to proceed, we need one.\n# Let's add a premise that makes the condition for Tom unmet for Olive Garden based on deposit.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2500).\n# The fact that 2500 > 2000 is implied by the scenario's context that deposit is >= rent.\n# We also know that 2500 > 1500.\n\n# Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n# This means: Rent(tom, b) is true IFF (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) AND DepositAmount(b, D) where D <= 1500).\n# The condition \"security deposit is no more than $1500\" can be expressed using LessThanOrEqual.\n# We need to state that for building `b`, if `DepositAmount(b, D)` is true, then `LessThanOrEqual(D, 1500)` must hold for Tom to consider renting.\n# The original premise was `\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))`.\n# The `DepositAmount(b, 1500)` part was problematic as it implied the deposit is exactly 1500.\n# A better representation uses a variable for the deposit amount.\n# However, to keep it simple and aligned with predicate usage, let's interpret the condition as checking against a potential deposit amount.\n\n# Corrected premise for Tom's renting condition:\n# The condition \"security deposit is no more than $1500\" for building `b` means that any stated `DepositAmount(b, D)` must satisfy `D <= 1500`.\n# This can be written as: `\u2200D (DepositAmount(b, D) \u2192 LessThanOrEqual(D, 1500))`.\n# So, Tom rents if `AllowedPet(fluffy, b)` AND `\u2200D (DepositAmount(b, D) \u2192 LessThanOrEqual(D, 1500))`.\n# Combining these:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u2200D (DepositAmount(b, D) \u2192 LessThanOrEqual(D, 1500))))).\n\n# Premise to establish allowed pets (example, as not explicitly given for Fluffy):\n# Assuming Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden for the sake of testing logic flow.\n# Without this, we cannot conclude Rent(tom, oliveGarden) or \u00acRent(tom, oliveGarden).\nAllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden).\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",

formulation.\n# \"security deposit is no more than $1500\" means DepositAmount(x, D) and D <= 1500.\n# We need a way to express the actual deposit amount for a building.\n# The original program used `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` within `LessThan`, which was incorrect.\n# Let's assume there's a way to know the deposit amount for a building, or that the deposit rules imply it.\n# Given the context, we

amount.\n# DepositValue(building, value) ::: The security deposit for building has the value.\n\n# Revised premise for rule 8:\n# Tom will rent apartment x in managed building y if and only if Fluffy is allowed in y AND the deposit for y is <= 1500.\n# We need to make sure the deposit is a specific amount for comparison.\n# The problem doesn't state the exact deposit for Olive Garden, only that it's >= 1 month's rent.\n# If RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), and deposit is >= 1 month's rent, then DepositValue(oliveGarden, D) where D >= 2000.\n# This directly violates the <= 1500 condition.\n\n#

and Deposit can be equal or more than one month's rent,\n# we can infer DepositValue(oliveGarden, D) where D >= 2000.\n# This would make the condition `DepositValue(oliveGarden, D) \u2227 D <= 1500`

`MoreThan(2000, 1500)` and `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and deposit >= rent,\n# the deposit is implicitly greater than 1500.\n\n# Let's simplify the premises by focusing on the stated facts and

evaluable, we need to state the deposit value or a property of it.\n# Let's explicitly state the deposit for Olive Garden based on the rule.\n# If deposit is >= 1 month's rent, and rent is 2000, then

RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# This makes `d > r` false (2000 > 2000).\n\n# Possible fix: Either remove DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) or acknowledge a conflict.\n# Given \"2000$ is more than 1500.\", this suggests a threshold comparison is intended for the deposit limit.\n# The condition for Tom renting is `\u00acMoreThan(d, 1500)`, meaning `d <= 1500`.\n# For Olive Garden, `d = 2000`. So `\u00acMoreThan(2000, 1500)` is false.\n# This means Tom will NOT rent at Olive Garden.\n\n# Let's try to align the deposit amount with the \"more than one month's rent\" condition.\n# If DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true, and RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000),\n# then DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) must be such that d > 2000.\n# The premise DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) contradicts this if DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true.\n\n# Let's assume the scenario implies:\n# 1. For any managed building x: DepositRequired(x) -> (DepositAmount(x, d) AND RentAmount(x, r) -> d >= r)\n# 2. DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) -> d = r\n# 3.

deposit amount is >= the rent amount.\n# And \"more\" implies strictly greater than.\n# The current premises are:\n# DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden).\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# The rule `\u2200x \u2200y (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 RentAmount(x, r) \u2192 (DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x) \u2192 d > r))`\n# leads to `2000 > 2000` if `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` is true, which is a contradiction.\n# Let's assume \"more than one month's rent\" means DepositAmount >= RentAmount AND DepositAmount != RentAmount.\n# Or, perhaps, the scenario implies that DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent means the deposit is strictly more.\n# If DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true, and DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000),\n# then the rule `d > r` is violated.\n# The scenario states: \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# This implies DepositAmount(x, d) and RentAmount(x, r) implies d >= r.\n# \"More\" could imply d > r.\n# If DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true, and RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000),\n# then DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent should not be true if d > r is required.\n# The premise `MoreThan(2000, 1500)` is about a comparison to a threshold, not directly about rent.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate:\n# \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# This implies for any managed building x, if deposit is required, then DepositAmount(x, d) and RentAmount(x, r) implies d >= r.\n# The original program had:\n# \u2200x \u2200y (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 RentAmount(x, r) \u2192 (DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x) \u2192 d > r)).\n# And \u2200x \u2200y (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 RentAmount(x, r) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2192 d = r)).\n# These seem correct if DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent means d > r and DepositEqualToOneMonthRent means d = r.\n# The issue is: DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is given as true.\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000). RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# This makes `d > r` false (2000 > 2000).\n\n# Possible fix: Either remove DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) or acknowledge a conflict.\n# Given \"2000$ is more than 1500.\", this suggests a threshold comparison is intended for the deposit limit.\n# The condition for Tom renting is `\u00acMoreThan(d, 1500)`, meaning `d <= 1500`.\n# For Olive Garden, `d = 2000`. So `\u00acMoreThan(2000, 1500)` is false.\n# This means Tom will NOT rent at Olive Garden.\n\n# Let's try to align the deposit amount with the \"more than one month's rent\" condition.\n# If DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true, and RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000),\n# then DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) must be such that d > 2000.\n# The premise DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) contradicts this if DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true.\n\n# Let's assume the scenario implies:\n# 1. For any managed building x: DepositRequired(x) -> (DepositAmount(x, d) AND RentAmount(x, r) -> d >= r)\n# 2. DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) -> d = r\n# 3. DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x) -> d > r\n# The provided premises:\n# ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden).\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden).\n# These premises create a contradiction with rule 3 above.\n\n# Revised approach:\n# Keep the rules about rent, deposit, and allowance.\n# Focus on how the facts align.\n# The fact \"2000$ is more than 1500.\" is crucial for the `\u00acMoreThan(d, 1500)` condition.\n# The fact \"DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden).\" seems problematic with DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n\n# Let's simplify the interpretation of \"security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\".\n# This can be simplified to: For a managed building x, DepositRequired(x) implies\n# \u2200d \u2200r (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 RentAmount(x, r) \u2192 d \u2265 r).\n# The existence of DepositEqualToOneMonthRent and DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent\n# allows for distinguishing these cases, but they may lead to contradictions with given facts.\n\n# Let's remove the specific DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) premise and let it be derived or not.\n# The main contradiction is between DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# and DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden).\n\n# Revised Premises based on fixing contradiction and sticking to logic:\n# We need to ensure premises are consistent and reflect the scenario.\n# The scenario states \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# This means DepositAmount >= RentAmount for managed buildings.\n# Let's assume DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent means d > r.\n# And DepositEqualToOneMonthRent means d = r.\n\n# Given:\n# ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden).\n# RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# These two facts mean DepositAmount is NOT strictly greater than RentAmount for Olive Garden.\n# Thus, `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` should be FALSE.\n# However, it's given as a premise. This is a bug.\n\n# Let's remove the premise `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)`.\n# And deduce if it's equal or not based on amounts.\n\n# Revised Plan:\n# 1. Keep basic facts and relations.\n# 2. Define DepositAmount and RentAmount.\n# 3. For managed buildings, DepositRequired implies DepositAmount >= RentAmount.\n# 4. Tom's renting condition involves AllowedPet and Deposit <= 1500.\n# 5. Remove the direct premise `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)` as it contradicts facts.\n# 6.

Tom rents in a managed building iff Fluffy is allowed AND deposit <= 1500.\n\n# Revised Premises:\n\n# Core facts about entities and their properties\nFluffy(fluffy)\nTom(tom)\nCat(fluffy)\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nOliveGarden(oliveGarden)\n\n# General rules\n\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))                   # All cats are pets.\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 DepositRequired(x)) # Deposits are required for managed buildings.\n\u2200x (DepositRequired(x) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x))) # Deposit is either equal to or more than one month's rent.\n\n# Specific facts about Olive Garden\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\nAllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden)             # Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden.\n\n# Explicit numerical comparisons given in the scenario\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)                       # $2000 is more than $1500.\n\n# Tom's renting condition:\n# Tom rents an apartment in a managed building if and only if Fluffy is allowed there,\n# and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n# Note: \u00acMoreThan(d, 1500) is equivalent to LessThanOrEqual(d, 1500) if d and 1500 are numbers.\n# Let's introduce LessThanOrEqual for clarity or stick to \u00acMoreThan.\n# The premise already has \u00acMoreThan(d, 1500) which correctly captures \"no more than $1500\".\n\n# The premise implicitly assumes that `Rent(tom, b)` only applies to managed buildings `b`.\n# The wording \"rent an apartment in a managed building\" confirms this.\n\u2200b ( ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192\n    (Rent(tom, b) \u2194\n     (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(d, 1500))))\n)\n\n# We can also add a premise that makes the deposit relationship explicit for managed buildings,\n# which is implied by the scenario but not directly a single statement:\n# For any managed building, the rent amount and deposit amount are defined, and the deposit\n# is either equal to or more than the rent.\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 \u2203r \u2203d (RentAmount(x, r) \u2227 DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 (d = r \u2228 MoreThan(d, r))))\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",

Let's assume 'y' refers to the building.\n\n# Revised Premise 1 (addressing deposit condition):\n# Original: \u2200x \u2200y (Rent(tom, y) \u2192 (MoveIn(tom, y) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, y) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(y, 1500), 1500))))\n# Fixed: \u2200y ( (ManagedBuilding(y) \u2227 Rent(tom, y)) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, y) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(y, d) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(d, 1500))) )\n# This requires us to make sure Rent(tom, y) implies ManagedBuilding(y) or is only applied when y is managed.\n# The context implies 'y' will be a managed building if Tom rents there.\n\n# Let's simplify the deposit condition for clarity within the context of the Olive Garden.\n# The core issue is the 'LessThan(DepositAmount(y, 1500), 1500)'.\n# If DepositAmount(y, 1500) is true, it means the deposit *is* 1500. Then LessThan(1500, 1500) is false.\n# The intent is deposit <= 1500.\n\n# Let's keep the structure and focus on the logical operators.\n# We need a way to say \"deposit is no more than 1500\".

DepositRequired(oliveGarden).\n#    - DepositAmount(oliveGarden, D) implies D >= 2000.\n#    - Since 2000 > 1500, D must be > 1500.\n#    - This means LessThanOrEqual(DepositAmount(oliveGarden), 1500) is FALSE.\n#    - Therefore, Tom will NOT rent an apartment in Olive Garden, because one of his conditions (deposit <= $1500) is not met.\n\n# Added predicates for clarity and completeness based on the logic for Tom renting:\nLessThanOrEqual(x, y) ::: x is less than or equal to y.\nDepositAmount(x, y) ::: The security deposit for building x is y.\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",
