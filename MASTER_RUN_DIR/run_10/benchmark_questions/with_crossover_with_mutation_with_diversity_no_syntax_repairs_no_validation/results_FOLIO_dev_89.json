This implies that gaining a book is equivalent to gaining knowledge.\n# This axiom can be used to link 'Gains(p, b)' to 'Gains(p, Knowledge(b))' if needed,\n# but here we simplify by directly using the book as the object of knowledge.\n# This is captured by Parent A's axiom: \u2200b (Book(b) \u2192 \u2203k (Knowledge(k) \u2227 Contains(b, k))).\n# Parent A's axiom is more explicit about the existence of knowledge within the book.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2200x (Smarter(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Gains(x, y)))\n",
