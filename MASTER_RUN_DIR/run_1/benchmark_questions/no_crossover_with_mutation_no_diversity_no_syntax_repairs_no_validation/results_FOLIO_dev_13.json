For example:\n# - `Company(company_A)` and `JapaneseCompany(company_A)` are fine, but the scenario focuses on the company *creating* the game, and the property of being Japanese for games in Top 10.\n# - `Sales(game_Zelda, sales_1M_plus)` and `sales_1M_plus > 1000000` are better captured by a single predicate like `SellsMoreThanMillion`.\n# - `Top10(game_Zelda)` is explicitly stated as a premise in the original, but the task is to *derive* this. The corrected program should allow derivation.\n\n# For clarity and to avoid introducing new predicates not in the original spirit:\n# We can define `SellsMoreThanMillion(x)` as a property that is true for games\n# that meet the sales criteria. The original program uses `Sell(x, y)` and `Million(y)`\n# and `sales_1M_plus > 1000000`.
