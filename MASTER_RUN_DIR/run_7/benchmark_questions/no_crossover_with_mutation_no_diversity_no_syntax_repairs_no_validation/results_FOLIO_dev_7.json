SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)\n# We need to bridge the gap: Virus in Human -> Human has Monkeypox -> Human feels tired.\n\n# Simpler approach to link symptoms to the disease instance:\n# If Monkeypox has FeelingTired as a symptom, then a person experiencing Monkeypox will feel tired.\n# This requires a predicate like `HasDisease(Person, Disease)` or `Experiencing(Person, Disease)`.\n# Without adding new predicates beyond those in the context, we can infer:\n# If MonkeypoxVirus occurs in a Human, and CausedBy(Monkeypox, MonkeypoxVirus), and Human implies Person, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# A person who is a Human and in whom MonkeypoxVirus occurs, will feel tired.\n\n# Let's add a premise that clarifies how symptoms manifest:\n\u2200x \u2200d (Human(x) \u2227 OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, x) \u2227 CausedBy(d, MonkeypoxVirus) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, d))\n# This connects the occurrence of the virus in a human to FeelingTired being a symptom of whatever disease is caused by that virus.\n\n# Simpler inference from \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include ... FeelingTired\":\n# If a person is infected with Monkeypox, they will feel tired.\n\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, p) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Monkeypox))\n# This connects the occurrence of the virus in a person to them feeling tired *when they have Monkeypox*.\n# This assumes `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, p)` implies the person has Monkeypox.\n\n# A more direct mapping based on the provided context:\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" and \"FeelingTired(x) ::: x is feeling tired.\"\n# The symptom is \"FeelingTired\". The cause of feeling tired is a \"glu\".\n# The scenario doesn't explicitly state that Monkeypox *is* a glu.\n# If the intent is that Monkeypox *causes* one to have a glu, then the connection can be made.\n# Let's assume Monkeypox is a type of \"glu\" for the purpose of feeling tired.\n# This requires a relationship between Monkeypox and Glu.\n# Let's add: `IsAGlu(Monkeypox)` or assume it implicitly.\n\n# Given the structure, the simplest fix is to ensure the stated symptoms are linked.\n# The existing premises cover the structure, but the connection between the virus in a human and them experiencing the symptoms needs to be clearer.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the symptom premise:\n# \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include Fever, Headache, MusclePains, and FeelingTired.\"\n# This is a statement about the disease itself, not about every instance of it.\n# So, `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)` is correct.\n\n# The missing link is how a person gets Monkeypox.\n# The virus occurs in humans, and the disease is caused by the virus. This implies humans can get Monkeypox.\n# So, if a Human gets Monkeypox, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, then the Human feels tired.\n# This requires a predicate like `HasDisease(Human, Monkeypox)` which can be inferred from `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human)` and `CausedBy(Monkeypox, MonkeypoxVirus)`.\n\n# Let's express the symptom link more directly:\n# If a person is a Human and the Monkeypox Virus occurs in them, then they will experience FeelingTired.\n\u2200h (Human(h) \u2192 (OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, h) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)))\n# This doesn't make sense. The symptom is of the disease, not the virus occurrence.\n\n# Correct way to link symptoms to infected individuals:\n# If a person has a disease, and a symptom is listed for that disease, then that person exhibits that symptom.\n# Let's introduce `HasDisease(Person, Disease)` as an inferred predicate.\n# `OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human)` implies `HasDisease(Human, Monkeypox)`.\n# `Human(x) -> Person(x)` means `HasDisease(Person, Monkeypox)`.\n\n# Final simplified and corrected premises:\nInfectiousDisease(Monkeypox)\nCausedBy(Monkeypox, MonkeypoxVirus)\n\u2200x (Animal(x) \u2192 OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, x)) # Virus occurs in animals (general statement)\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x))\n\u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\nSymptomOf(Fever, Monkeypox)\nSymptomOf(Headache, Monkeypox)\nSymptomOf(MusclePains, Monkeypox)\nSymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Glu(y) \u2227 FeelTiredWhen(x, y))) # People feel tired when they get a glu.\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))\nOccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human) # Virus can occur in humans.\n\n# Added premise to connect the symptoms to the disease manifestation in humans.\n# If a human is infected with Monkeypox (virus occurs in them), and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, then they feel tired.\n# This implicitly connects the virus to the disease and the disease to the person.\n# The most direct inference from the scenario's phrasing is that the virus in a human leads to them having the disease, and thus experiencing symptoms.\n\u2200h (Human(h) \u2227 OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, h) \u2192 (SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(h, Monkeypox)))\n# This formulation states that if a human has the virus, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, then that human feels tired when they have Monkeypox.\n\n# A more explicit statement of how symptoms manifest:\n# If a person has Monkeypox, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, then that person feels tired.\n# We can infer \"Person has Monkeypox\" from \"Human\" and \"OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, Human)\" and \"CausedBy(Monkeypox, MonkeypoxVirus)\".\n# Let's make the link from virus occurrence to symptom manifestation:\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2227 OccurIn(MonkeypoxVirus, x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Monkeypox))\n# This states that if a human has the virus, they feel tired when they have Monkeypox.

If Monkeypox is also associated with feeling tired (as a symptom), it follows a similar pattern.\n\n# The original symptom premise was:\n# `\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 (SymptomOf(Fever, x) \u2228 SymptomOf(Headache, x) \u2228 SymptomOf(MusclePains, x) \u2228 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)))`\n# This means for any instance of Monkeypox, it has at least one of these symptoms.\n# The simpler `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, Monkeypox)` asserts that FeelingTired is a symptom of the disease in general.\n\n# Let's stick to the simpler symptom assertion. The core issue is connecting this to a person.\n# The premise that needs the most adjustment is how the symptoms are applied.\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" and \"FeelingTired(x) ::: x is feeling tired.\"\n\n# New approach:\n# If a person is a human, and the Monkeypox Virus occurs in them, then they are infected with Monkeypox.\n# If a person is infected with Monkeypox, and FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox, then that person feels tired.\n\n# Let's rephrase the symptom premise and the glu premise to be more consistent.\n# \"Symptoms of Monkeypox include...\" means these are attributes of Monkeypox.\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\" means this is a condition for feeling tired.\n\n# If we assume \"FeelingTired\" is a symptom that manifests when a person has Monkeypox.\n# And Monkeypox is a disease caused by the virus, which occurs in humans.\n\n# Corrected Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",

This is the source of the bug.\n# If we interpret `Glu(x)` to mean \"x is an instance of glu\", then the premise means:\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 x is an instance of glu \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n# This implies a person can *be* an instance of glu, which is still strange.\n\n# Let's introduce a predicate that signifies a person *having* a condition.\n# We can redefine `Glu(x)`'s meaning slightly, or use an implicit relation.\n# The simplest fix, without adding new predicates not defined, is to assume `Glu(x)` means \"x is a glu condition\".\n# But the definition is \"x is a glu\".\n\n# Let's consider the `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` predicate.\n# It could be used as: `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2227 instance_of(g, GluType) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))`\n# This requires inferring `instance_of` and `is_gotten_by`.\n\n# Let's focus on fixing the existing premise: `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n# The definition `Glu(x) ::: x is a glu` is the problem.\n# The sentence is \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n\n# Correction: Change the interpretation of `Glu(x)`'s role in the premise.\n# Assume `Glu(x)` signifies that `x` is an instance of 'glu' (a disease/condition).\n# Then the premise `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` means:\n# \"For any `x`, if `x` is a `Person` and `x` is an instance of `glu`, then `x` feels tired.\"\n# This still has `x` being both a `Person` and an instance of `glu`.\n\n# Let's rephrase the premise using `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` as it was defined and unused.\n# We need a way to say that if `x` is a `Person` and `y` is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired when `x` gets `y`.\n# This requires a `Gets(x, y)` predicate.\n\n# The simplest fix is to assume the original intent was closer to:\n# For any `x`, if `x` is a `Person` and `x` *has* a glu (as a condition), then `FeelingTired(x)`.\n# The predicate `Glu(x)` defined as `x is a glu` is problematic.\n# If we assume `Glu(x)` is meant to represent a *condition* affecting `x`, then the premise is okay.\n# But the definition is \"x is a glu\".\n\n# Let's try to keep the original premise and just make it slightly more robust by ensuring `FeelingTired` is also a symptom.\n# However, the task is to fix bugs/edge cases or simplify logic.\n# The main bug is the logical interpretation of `Glu(x)`.\n\n# Let's introduce a new predicate that represents the *state* of having a glu, distinct from being a glu.\n# New Predicate: `HasGlu(x) ::: x has glu`.\n# Then the premise would be: `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 HasGlu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`.\n# This is not allowed, as we cannot add new predicates.\n\n# The only way to fix the premise `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` without adding predicates\n# or changing the definition of `Glu(x)` is to reinterpret its usage.\n# The definition is `Glu(x) ::: x is a glu`.\n# The premise is `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`.\n# This means: if x is a person AND x is a glu, then x feels tired.\n\n# Let's assume the problem implicitly means that 'glu' is a disease, and `Glu(x)` is meant to signify that `x` is an instance of this disease.\n# Then `Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x)` would mean `x` is a person *and* `x` is an instance of glu.\n# This interpretation is still awkward.\n\n# Simplest fix: Assume `Glu(x)` is a property of `x` that indicates `x` is experiencing a glu.\n# And `FeelingTired(x)` is a property of `x` that indicates `x` is feeling tired.\n# The premise: `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n# This means: If `x` is a person and `x` is afflicted by `glu`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This is the most charitable interpretation given the constraints.\n\n# Let's ensure that 'feeling tired' is a symptom of Monkeypox.

(The premise doesn't preclude this, `FeelingTired(x)` can be true for other reasons)\n\n# The definition of `FeelingTired(x)` is \"x is feeling tired\". This is a state.\n# The definition of `Glu(x)` is \"x is a glu\". This is a thing.\n# The premise tries to connect a person *being* a thing (`Glu(x)`) with a state (`FeelingTired(x)`).\n\n# The most faithful fix to the original premise `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n# given the definitions `Person(x)` and `Glu(x)` is to assume `Glu(x)` is meant to represent\n# that `x` is somehow characterized by `glu` in a way that leads to fatigue.\n# A slight reinterpretation of the usage of `Glu(x)` within this premise:\n# If `x` is a person, and `x` *has* `glu` (as a condition), then `x` feels tired.\n# This is what the premise expresses, assuming `Glu(x)` is shorthand for \"x has glu\".\n# This is a logical simplification by assuming a more natural interpretation of the statement.\n\n# Let's ensure consistency with the given vocabulary.\n# The original set of predicates includes `Person(x)` and `Glu(x)`.\n# The problematic premise is `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`.\n# This can be simplified by assuming `Glu(x)` here represents the *state* of having a glu,\n# rather than `x` *being* a glu.
