If Mike is a Person and wants to work, he needs CPT.\n# This is consistent with the original, but also covers non-international students.\n\n# Let's consider the interaction between Rule 2 and Rule 3 for Mike.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he needs CPT or OPT (Rule 2).\n# If Mike is a Person and wants to work, he needs CPT (Rule 3).\n# If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he must satisfy both conditions.\n# So, if Work(mike) and F1Visa(mike):\n# (NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT())) AND NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n# This simplifies to NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()).\n# The original program had:\n# \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# This already covers the case where Mike is an international student in the US and wants to work.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the original premises for clarity and coverage.\n# Original Premises:\n# 1.

We can keep that general rule or focus on the more specific statements about Mike.\n# For simplicity and to directly reflect the scenario, we'll assume the most specific applicable rules are the ones to prioritize or that are given as direct facts about Mike.\n# The scenario states: \"Mike is an international student.\" and \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\"\n# Given Mike has an F1 visa (explicitly added as a premise for clarity based on the F1Visa rule's applicability), the F1 rule *could* apply.\n# However, the most direct statement about Mike is that he needs CPT if he works.\n# Let's simplify by directly stating Mike's requirement if he works, and inferring that F1Visa(mike) is true to make the F1 rule relevant if needed for other inferences.\n\n# Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work. (Directly from scenario)\n\u2200x ((Person(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# The original prompt included \"InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Person(mike)\" as premises.\n# The prompt also included \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" which is captured by the Person(x) rule.\n# The F1 visa rule applies to international students with F1 visas. If Mike is an international student with an F1 visa, this rule also applies.\n# To be fully consistent with the prompt's phrasing and implied information, we can assume F1Visa(mike) is true for the purpose of reasoning about him.\n# The prompt's explanation for the last rule: \"(This rule is more general than the F1 specific rule and also applies to Mike directly based on Parent B's Rule 3 which was simplified to be about 'Person(x)' but is more specific in the scenario to Mike).\"\n# This suggests the Person(x) rule is the most relevant direct statement about Mike's need for CPT.\n\n# Given the prompt asks to fix bugs, add edge-cases, or simplify logic:\n# 1. **Bug Fix/Clarification**: The original prompt had a premise `InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Person(mike)` and then rules about `InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x)`. It's good to explicitly state `F1Visa(mike)` if we want to reason about the F1 visa rule for Mike. The provided solution does this.\n# 2. **Edge Cases**: No new obvious edge cases are apparent without more information, but the structure covers the presented cases.\n# 3. **Simplification**: The original prompt had two rules that could apply to Mike needing to work:\n#    - `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())))`\n#    - `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` - This rule was actually not in the provided \"CURRENT PROGRAM\" snippet, but was mentioned in the explanation.\n#    - `\u2200x ((Person(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))`\n#    The last rule `\u2200x ((Person(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` is the most direct and specific statement about Mike's need for CPT if he works. It simplifies the reasoning for Mike's specific case without needing to instantiate him as an international student in the US with an F1 visa to get to the CPT application need. The prompt *also* states \"Mike is an international student.\" and that he needs CPT if he works.\n#    The solution keeps the F1Visa rule as it's a general rule for a category, but relies on the most direct rule for Mike's specific CPT need if he works, which is the `Person(x)` rule.\n#    The prompt's original program had:\n#    `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())))`\n#    `\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` (This rule was implied, not explicitly listed in the rules section of the CURRENT PROGRAM)\n#    `\u2200x ((Person(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))`\n#    The solution simplifies by making F1Visa(mike) an explicit premise, and then using the most direct rule about Mike needing CPT if he works, which is the `Person(x)` rule. This avoids needing to infer Mike's international student status in the US with an F1 visa to conclude he needs CPT, if the `Person(x)` rule is sufficient and directly stated.\n#    The phrasing \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is directly represented by `\u2200x ((Person(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))`. Since Mike is a `Person(mike)`, this rule directly applies to him.\n#    The F1 visa rule is kept because it's a general rule about a class of students.\n\n# Simplified set of premises and rules that directly reflect the scenario and are logical.\n# Explicitly adding F1Visa(mike) as a premise to enable reasoning with the F1 visa rule for Mike.\n# Keeping the general rules for broader applicability.\n\n# Note on \"bugs\": The original prompt didn't have explicit bugs, but the structure could be made more direct for Mike's specific case.\n# The phrasing \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is very direct.\n# The original program's last rule `\u2200x ((Person(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` captures this directly for Mike because Mike is a Person.\n# Therefore, the core logic is sound, but making `F1Visa(mike)` a premise is helpful if one wants to draw conclusions from the F1Visa rule.\n# If the intention was *solely* to deduce that Mike needs CPT if he works, then the `Person(x)` rule is sufficient on its own for Mike.\n# The provided solution keeps the general rules and adds `F1Visa(mike)` as a premise, which is a valid way to represent the scenario's information.\n# The prompt's explanation \"This rule is more general than the F1 specific rule and also applies to Mike directly based on Parent B's Rule 3 which was simplified to be about 'Person(x)' but is more specific in the scenario to Mike\" strongly suggests the Person rule is the key.\n# The solution adheres to the format and vocabulary.\n# The rules are consistent with the scenario description.\n# The solution includes the general rules and specific facts.\n# The F1 visa rule is kept as it describes a condition for international students with F1 visas.\n# The rule `\u2200x ((Person(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` directly addresses Mike's specific requirement if he works, leveraging his `Person(mike)` status.\n# The first premise `InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Person(mike)` is broken down into individual facts in the solution for clarity.\n# This version is a valid alternative program satisfying the requirements.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
