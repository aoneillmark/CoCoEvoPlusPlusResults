This is already covered by explicit premises, but it's good that the rule enforces it.\n\n# What about `\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00acGerman(x))` in the original program?\n# This implies that no Romance Language can BE German. This is consistent with German not being a Romance language.\n# If we have `German(german)` and `RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00acGerman(x)`, then `German(german)` implies `\u00acRomanceLanguage(german)`.\n# This is good.\n# However, the original premise was `\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00acGerman(x))`.\n# This implies that IF something is a Romance Language, THEN it is NOT German.\n# This is equivalent to saying `\u00ac\u2203x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2227 German(x))`.\n# This is not the same as saying German is not a Romance language.\n# `\u2200x (German(x) \u2192 \u00acRomanceLanguage(x))` is the correct statement that German is not a Romance language.\n# So, the premise `\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00acGerman(x))` should be removed and replaced by `\u2200x (German(x) \u2192 \u00acRomanceLanguage(x))`.\n\n# And similarly for Basque.\n# Original: `\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00acBasque(x))`\n# Should be: `\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u00acRomanceLanguage(x))`\n\n# So, the updated premises:\n# Original premises with corrections/removals:\n# \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(x))  -- Keep\n# \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 BelongsToFamily(x, RomanceFamily)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (BelongsToFamily(x, z) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(y, z) \u2192 Related(x, y)) -- Keep\n# RomanceLanguage(french) -- Keep\n# RomanceLanguage(spanish) -- Keep\n# Related(german, spanish) -- Keep (Original had this, and also contradictions)\n# \u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Language(y) \u2227 y \u2260 x \u2227 Related(x, y))) -- Keep (This is good for Basque's isolation)\n# \u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (Spanish(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (German(x) \u2192 Language(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 Language(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (French(x) \u2192 Language(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (Spanish(x) \u2192 Language(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (IndoEuropeanLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x (LanguageFamily(x) \u2192 \u00acLanguage(x)) -- Keep\n# \u2200x \u2200y (Related(x, y) \u2192 (Language(x) \u2227 Language(y))) -- Keep\n# LanguageFamily(RomanceFamily) -- Keep\n\n# Premises to remove/modify:\n# Remove: \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00acGerman(x))  -- Incorrect, replace with \u2200x (German(x) \u2192 \u00acRomanceLanguage(x))\n# Remove: \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 \u00acBasque(x))  -- Incorrect, replace with \u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u00acRomanceLanguage(x))\n# Remove all \u00acRelated statements that contradict explicit statements or inferences:\n# \u00acRelated(french, spanish)\n# \u00acRelated(spanish, french)\n# \u00acRelated(french, german)\n# \u00acRelated(german, french)\n# \u00acRelated(spanish, german)\n# \u00acRelated(german, spanish)\n\n# Add explicit language instances:\n# French(french)\n# Spanish(spanish)\n# German(german)\n# Basque(basque)\n\n# Add corrected premises for German/Basque not being Romance.\n# \u2200x (German(x) \u2192 \u00acRomanceLanguage(x))\n# \u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u00acRomanceLanguage(x))\n\n# Add symmetry for `Related` if it's intended and not handled by axioms.
