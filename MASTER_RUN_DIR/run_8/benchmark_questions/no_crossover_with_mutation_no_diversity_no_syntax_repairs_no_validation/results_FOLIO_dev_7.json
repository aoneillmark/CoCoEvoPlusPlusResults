This implies that the *concept* of Fever is a symptom of the *instance* of Monkeypox.\n# A more natural interpretation is that instances of Monkeypox have certain symptoms.\n# Let's redefine: if X is Monkeypox, then Fever is a symptom of X. This is still a bit clunky.\n# A cleaner approach might be to say: If x has Monkeypox, then x exhibits symptoms like fever, headache, etc.\n# Or, that the *set* of symptoms for Monkeypox includes {Fever, Headache, MusclePains, FeelingTired}.\n\n# Let's rephrase the symptom part to be more direct:\n# If x has Monkeypox, then Fever is a symptom of x.\n# This means we need to relate instances of Monkeypox to symptom predicates.\n# The original implies 'Fever' is a specific symptom entity, not a predicate for experiencing fever.\n# Let's assume Fever, Headache, MusclePains, FeelingTired are specific symptom instances.\nSymptom(fever)\nSymptom(headache)\nSymptom(musclePains)\nSymptom(feelingTired)\n\n# Associating specific symptoms with Monkeypox\nSymptomOf(fever, mp)\nSymptomOf(headache, mp)\nSymptomOf(musclePains, mp)\nSymptomOf(feelingTired, mp)\n\n# A person feels tired when they get a glu.\n# This implies a causal link: Glu causes feeling tired in a person.\n# The original premise: \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, x)) is problematic.\n# It states that if a person is a Glu, then they feel tired when they get themselves.

FeelTiredWhen(person, glu) - This seems like an instantiation, but 'person' is not a variable.

This also seems too strong, a glu is not a condition itself that *causes* feeling tired, but rather a condition that, when experienced by a person, leads to feeling tired.\n\n# Let's refine the understanding of \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This means if someone is a Person and they have a Glu, then they will FeelTired.\n# We need predicates for 'Person' and 'Glu' as conditions.\n# Assuming 'person' in the original was meant as a generic entity representing any person.\nPerson(p)  # Assuming 'p' represents a generic person for instantiation purposes\nGlu(g)    # Assuming 'g' represents a generic glu for instantiation purposes\n\n# Corrected logic for feeling tired:\n# If an entity is a Person and experiences a Glu, then that entity will feel tired.\n# We will represent 'getting a glu' as the Glu predicate being true for the person.\n# So, if a person 'p' has 'g' (where g is a Glu), then p feels tired.\n\u2200x \u2200y (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(y) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, y))\n# The original 'FeelTiredWhen(person, glu)' might have been an attempt to instantiate this.\n# Let's keep it simple and rely on the general rule above.\n\n# To connect symptoms to a person:\n# If someone has monkeypox, they might experience feeling tired as a symptom.\n# And if they have a glu, they feel tired.\n# The original program had:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x)) - This is too broad. A person is not always tired.\n# \u2200x (Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x)) - This is also too broad. A glu itself doesn't make one tired, it's the person experiencing it.\n\n# Revised approach for 'FeelingTired':\n# FeelingTired is a state.\n# Monkeypox can be a SymptomOf FeelingTired.\n# Experiencing Glu can lead to FeelingTired.\n\n# Let's define FeelingTired as a state that a Person can be in.\nFeelingTired(x) ::: x is feeling tired.\nPerson(x) ::: x is a person.\n\n# SymptomOf(feelingTired, mp) already implies that feeling tired is a symptom of monkeypox.\n# This means if someone has monkeypox, they might feel tired.\n\n# The statement \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" can be encoded as:\n# If 'x' is a Person and 'x' experiences 'g' (where 'g' is a Glu), then 'x' is FeelingTired.\n# To model \"getting a glu\", we can use an existential quantifier or imply it through context if the predicates are sufficient.\n# Let's assume `Glu(x)` means 'x' has a glu.\n# So, if a person `p` has a glu `g`, then `p` is feeling tired.\n# This implies a relation between a person and a glu.\n# For simplicity, we can say if a person `x` is `Glu` (meaning they have a glu), then `x` is `FeelingTired`.\n# This conflates the person and the condition, which might be an intended simplification of the original.\n# Let's use the original `FeelTiredWhen` predicate to capture the conditional aspect.\n\n# Reinterpreting the original statement: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This means if 'x' is a Person and 'x' gets a 'glu' (represented by `Glu(glu_instance)`), then `x` is `FeelingTired`.\n# The original `FeelTiredWhen(person, glu)` is problematic.\n# A more precise encoding is:\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 \u2203g (Glu(g) \u2227 x experiences g \u2192 FeelingTired(x)))\n# This is complex.

This is too strong.\n# A person is not always tired. This seems like a bug. We will remove it.\n\n# The original `\u2200x (Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` is also too strong if `Glu(x)` means 'x is a glu'.\n# A glu itself is not feeling tired.

This directly models the \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" statement.\n# The connection to Monkeypox is made through `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, monkeypox)` and the fact that Monkeypox can occur in Humans.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",

These broad implications are likely bugs.\n\n# New premises:\n# Monkeypox(mp)\n# InfectiousDisease(mp)\n# CausedBy(mp, mpv)\n# MonkeypoxVirus(mpv)\n# OccurIn(mpv, humans) # Assuming 'humans' refers to the class of humans.\n# \u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))\n# \u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x)) # Direct translation of \"Humans are mammals.\"\n# \u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x)) # Direct translation of \"Mammals are animals.\"\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, glu)) # Direct translation of \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n\n# Specific symptoms for Monkeypox\n# SymptomOf(Fever, mp)\n# SymptomOf(Headache, mp)\n# SymptomOf(MusclePains, mp)\n# SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)\n\n# This set of premises is more direct, removes overly broad rules, and correctly incorporates the \"Humans are mammals\" statement.\n\n# Let's consider the scenario \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, glu))`\n# This means if a Person `p` gets `glu`, then `p` feels tired.\n# It does not imply that Monkeypox causes 'glu', nor that 'glu' is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# It's an independent fact about people and 'glu'.\n\n# The original program has:\n# \u2200x (InfectiousDisease(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x))\n# This implies if something is an infectious disease, it causes FeelingTired.\n# Since Monkeypox(mp) and InfectiousDisease(mp), this implies SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp).\n# This is also explicitly stated as `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)`.\n# The redundant and overly general rule can be removed.\n\n# Final set of premises:\n# Keep all specific facts about Monkeypox.\n# Correct the inheritance hierarchy for animals/mammals/humans.\n# Remove overly general rules about infectious diseases.\n\nMonkeypox(mp)\nInfectiousDisease(mp)\nCausedBy(mp, mpv)\nMonkeypoxVirus(mpv)\nOccurIn(mpv, humans)\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Person(x))\n\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x))\n\u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x))\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, glu))\nSymptomOf(Fever, mp)\nSymptomOf(Headache, mp)\nSymptomOf(MusclePains, mp)\nSymptomOf(FeelingTired, mp)\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",
