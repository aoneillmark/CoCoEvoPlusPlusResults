The problem states \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# But then it immediately pivots to Michael's abilities: \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# This suggests Michael's blocking is not limited to blocking other men, but any person, provided he is taller.\n# The original `\u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))` seems too general, it doesn't use height.\n# The scenario says \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# And then \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\"\n# And then \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# This last statement is key for Michael.

This implies Peter is a person.\n# The explicit rule `\u2200x (Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y) \u2192 Block(x, y))` is replaced by a more general rule for Michael's blocking.\n# If we want to keep the rule about men blocking men, it would look like:\n# \u2200x \u2200y (Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y) \u2192 Block(x, y))\n# But this contradicts Michael not being able to block Windy if Windy is a man and taller.\n# The current structure focuses on Michael's blocking capabilities and exceptions.\n\n# Reconsidering the first premise in the original:\n# \u2200x \u2200y (Taller(x, y) \u2192 Person(x) \u2227 Person(y))\n# This is a good general premise to keep.\n\n# The statement \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class\" can be encoded as:\n# Man(michael)\n# \u2200y (Class(y) \u2192 Taller(michael, y))\n\n# The statement \"If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, than x is taller than z\" is transitivity.\n# \u2200x \u2200y \u2200z ((Taller(x, y) \u2227 Taller(y, z)) \u2192 Taller(x, z))\n\n# The statement \"Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.\"\n# Man(peter)\n# Taller(peter, michael)\n\n# The statement \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# This implies Michael's blocking is conditional on his height relative to the person and their jumping.\n# The previous implementation used `Taller(michael, x)` which implies Michael is taller.\n# Let's refine this. The problem states \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# But then it immediately pivots to Michael's abilities: \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# This suggests Michael's blocking is not limited to blocking other men, but any person, provided he is taller.\n# The original `\u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))` seems too general, it doesn't use height.\n# The scenario says \"If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.\"\n# And then \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\"\n# And then \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# This last statement is key for Michael. It implies height is the condition for Michael blocking.\n# So, if Michael is taller than person x, and x does not jump, Michael can block x.\n# We need to ensure `Taller(michael, x)` is established.\n# Given Michael is taller than everyone in his class, he can block anyone in his class who doesn't jump.\n# The general rule of blocking is tied to height.\n# Let's assume Michael being taller than `x` is the prerequisite for him to be able to block `x`'s shooting.\n# If `Taller(michael, x)` is true, and `\u00acJump(x)` is true, then `Block(michael, x)` is true.\n# This covers \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\" assuming Michael is taller than that person.\n\n# Let's rewrite Michael's blocking:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Taller(michael, x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n# This is more precise.\n\n# The premise \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.\" is an explicit exception.\n# \u00acBlock(michael, windy)\n\n# \"Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.\"\n# \u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 Jump(x) \u2192 GreatShooter(x))\n# This premise is correct.\n\n# Implicitly, we need to define who is a person and who is a shooter if not explicitly mentioned.\n# The predicates `Man(michael)`, `Man(peter)`, `Windy(windy)` imply they are persons.\n# `Shooter(windy)` is given.\n\n# Let's ensure all entities are typed.\n# We have Man(michael), Man(peter).\n# We have Windy(windy) and Shooter(windy).\n# We have Class(y) implying y is a person.\n# Taller(x, y) implies x and y are persons.\n\n# Revised premises based on clarity and edge cases:\n\nMan(michael)\nMan(peter)\nPerson(michael)\nPerson(peter)\nWindy(windy)\nShooter(windy)\n\n# If x is taller than y, then x and y are persons.\n\u2200x \u2200y (Taller(x, y) \u2192 Person(x) \u2227 Person(y))\n\n# Transitivity of Taller\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z ((Taller(x, y) \u2227 Taller(y, z)) \u2192 Taller(x, z))\n\n# Peter is taller than Michael.\nTaller(peter, michael)\n\n# Michael is taller than everyone in his class.\n\u2200y (Class(y) \u2192 Taller(michael, y))\n\n# Michael can block the shooting of a person if he is taller than that person and they do not jump.\n# This captures \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.\"\n# by making height a prerequisite for Michael's blocking.\n\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Taller(michael, x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))\n\n# Michael cannot block Windy's shooting (an explicit exception).\n\u00acBlock(michael, windy)\n\n# Shooters who can jump are great shooters.\n\u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 Jump(x) \u2192 GreatShooter(x))\n\n# Note: The original encoding had `\u2200x (Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y) \u2192 Block(x, y))`.\n# This is a general rule about men blocking men.\n# However, the problem's focus shifts to Michael's specific blocking abilities and exceptions.\n# If we assume Michael's blocking is *only* based on height and non-jumping, the above is sufficient.\n# If the intent was to also have a general rule about any man blocking any other man he's taller than,\n# that rule would need to be added and then Michael's specific rule and Windy's exception handled.\n# The current phrasing \"Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting\"\n# suggests Michael's capability is a specific case, not necessarily governed by a general \"man vs man\" rule.\n# The current solution prioritizes the specific rules given for Michael and Windy.\n# The original had `\u2200x (Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))`, which was too broad as it didn't require Michael to be taller.\n# The revised rule for Michael `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Taller(michael, x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x) \u2192 Block(michael, x))` is more aligned.\n# The existence of `Taller(peter, michael)` means Peter is a person.\n# If Peter were also a shooter and didn't jump, Michael could block him (unless there's another exception).\n# The absence of a `Shooter(peter)` declaration means we cannot infer if Peter shoots.\n\n# We still need to make sure that `Class(y)` implies `Person(y)`.\n# The problem states \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\"\n# This implies people in the class are relevant entities.\n# It is reasonable to assume members of a class are persons.\n\n# Adding premise: Members of Michael's class are persons.\n\u2200y (Class(y) \u2192 Person(y))\n\n# Conclusion:\nBlock(peter, windy)\n",
