of constituents and their relation to Yale.\n# The `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` premise already states the total number of units.\n# The sum of explicitly listed residential colleges (14) + graduate school (1) = 15.\n# This leaves 27 - 15 = 12 units unaccounted for, which are the professional schools.\n# We can add a premise to confirm this.\n\n# Additional premise to ensure the professional schools are accounted for in the total count.\n# This premise links the *category* of professional schools to Yale.\n# We can infer the existence of these schools from the total count and the listed ones.\n# To make the encoding more explicit about professional schools, we can introduce a predicate\n# that signifies the existence of at least one professional school related to Yale,\n# and acknowledge that the remaining units are professional schools.\n\n# Let's refine the representation to reflect the structure.\n# We've listed 14 residential colleges and 1 graduate school. That's 15 units.\n# The total is 27. So, 27 - 15 = 12 professional schools.\n\n# To explicitly represent the \"twelve professional schools\" without naming them:\n# We can assert that there are 12 units of type ProfessionalSchool belonging to Yale.\n# This requires a way to count or assert the existence of multiple entities of a type.\n# A simpler approach given the prompt's structure is to just ensure that the categories are represented.\n# The existing premises about ResidentialCollege, GraduateSchool, and the implicit understanding of ProfessionalSchools\n# cover the types mentioned in the scenario.\n# The current listing of 14 residential colleges and 1 graduate school already accounts for 15 distinct constituent units.\n# The premise `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` establishes the total number.\n# The gap (27 - 15 = 12) is implicitly filled by professional schools.\n# We can add a specific predicate for the \"twelve professional schools\" as a group if needed, but it might complicate things.\n# For now, the current structure is sound by listing the known constituent units and their types,\n# and relying on the `OrganizedInto` premise for the total.\n\n# Re-evaluating: the prompt asks to fix bugs, add missing edge cases, or simplify logic.\n# One potential simplification is to use a more direct predicate for `OrganizedInto` if the exact breakdown is always implied.\n# However, the current structure is clear.\n# The prompt uses \"constituent colleges and schools\". My `ConstituentUnit` predicate is a good generalization.\n# The `Name(x, y)` predicate was renamed to `CollegeName(x, y)` for better clarity in this context.\n# The `Organized(x, y)` was renamed to `OrganizedInto(x, y)` for better clarity.\n# The structure `BelongsTo(x, y)` is a good addition for clarity about which university each constituent belongs to.\n# The distinction between `ResidentialCollege`, `GraduateSchool`, and `ProfessionalSchool` is maintained.\n# The premise `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` correctly states the total number of constituent units.\n# The 14 residential colleges + 1 graduate school + 12 professional schools = 27 units.\n# The encoding explicitly lists the 14 residential colleges and the graduate school.\n# The existence of the twelve professional schools is implicitly accounted for by the total count.\n# If we wanted to *assert* the existence of these professional schools as individual entities,\n# we would need to introduce them as individuals. But the prompt doesn't provide names.\n# The simplest way to represent \"twelve professional schools\" without naming them is to acknowledge their existence as a category.\n# The current premises are consistent with the scenario information.\n\n# Final check for bugs/edge cases:\n# - The original `Organized(x, y)` predicate was potentially ambiguous as to what 'y' represented (e.g., a number or a list of schools). `OrganizedInto(x, y)` where 'y' is a count is clearer.\n# - The distinction between the university itself and its constituents is well-maintained.\n# - The specific names of residential colleges are correctly encoded.\n# - The Yale Graduate School is correctly identified.\n# - The \"professional schools\" are addressed by acknowledging their existence as a category that makes up the remainder of the 27 units.\n\n# No major bugs found that need fixing in the logic. The simplifications are primarily in naming conventions and adding the `BelongsTo` predicate for better structure. The handling of \"professional schools\" is as explicit as possible given the lack of individual names in the source text.\n\n# Let's consider the prompt's example of a \"placeholder for actual name\" for professional schools.\n# This implies we might need to represent that there *are* professional schools.\n# The current code does not have individual predicates for the 12 professional schools.\n# However, the `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` and the explicit listing of 15 other constituents implies the existence of these 12 professional schools.\n\n# To make it more explicit, one could add a premise like:\n# ForAll x, (ProfessionalSchool(x) & BelongsTo(x, yale)) -> ConstituentUnit(x)\n# But this is redundant with `ConstituentUnit(x)` being a super-predicate.\n\n# A simpler approach to ensure the professional schools are acknowledged:\n# We can assert the existence of at least one professional school belonging to Yale.\n# Or, if we want to be specific about the *count*, it's trickier in first-order logic without auxiliary predicates or existential quantification over a collection.\n# Given the constraint to not add new sections, we'll stick to the current explicit premises.\n\n# The original program's `Constituent(x)` predicate was very general. Renaming it to `ConstituentUnit(x)` is more precise.\n# The original program had `Name(x, y)` as a general predicate, which was then used for colleges and schools. Using `CollegeName(x, y)` is more specific to the domain.\n\n# The `YearMovedTo` predicate in the original was `YearMovedTo(yale, newHaven, 1716)`. This is already quite specific and correct.\n\n# One area of potential improvement is the handling of the \"twelve professional schools.\"\n# The original code had placeholders like `Constituent(yaleSchoolOfArt)` and `Name(yaleSchoolOfArt, \"a professional school\")`. This implies creating dummy individuals.\n# The current revised program avoids creating dummy individuals for the professional schools since their names are not provided. Instead, it relies on the total count `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` and the explicit listing of the other 15 constituents. This is a cleaner approach.\n\n# Therefore, the changes made are primarily for clarity and a more structured representation,\n# while the logic remains sound and the handling of underspecified information (professional schools) is more robust.\n# The use of `BelongsTo` clearly links constituents to Yale.\n# The predicates are more descriptive (`ConstituentUnit`, `CollegeName`).\n# The handling of the 27 units is consistent with the text.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (University(x) \u2227 EndowmentValue(x, y) \u2227 y > 42300000000)\n",

My `ConstituentUnit` predicate is a good generalization.\n# The `Name(x, y)` predicate was renamed to `CollegeName(x, y)` for better clarity in this context.\n# The `Organized(x, y)` was renamed to `OrganizedInto(x, y)` for better clarity.\n# The structure `BelongsTo(x, y)` is a good addition for clarity about which university each constituent belongs to.\n# The distinction between `ResidentialCollege`, `GraduateSchool`, and `ProfessionalSchool` is maintained.\n# The premise `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` correctly states the total number of constituent units.\n# The 14 residential colleges + 1 graduate school + 12 professional schools = 27 units.\n# The encoding explicitly lists the 14 residential colleges and the graduate school.\n# The existence of the twelve professional schools is implicitly accounted for by the total count.\n# If we wanted to *assert* the existence of these professional schools as individual entities,\n# we would need to introduce them as individuals. But the prompt doesn't provide names.\n# The simplest way to represent \"twelve professional schools\" without naming them is to acknowledge their existence as a category.\n# The current premises are consistent with the scenario information.\n\n# Final check for bugs/edge cases:\n# - The original `Organized(x, y)` predicate was potentially ambiguous as to what 'y' represented (e.g., a number or a list of schools). `OrganizedInto(x, y)` where 'y' is a count is clearer.\n# - The distinction between the university itself and its constituents is well-maintained.\n# - The specific names of residential colleges are correctly encoded.\n# - The Yale Graduate School is correctly identified.\n# - The \"professional schools\" are addressed by acknowledging their existence as a category that makes up the remainder of the 27 units.\n\n# No major bugs found that need fixing in the logic. The simplifications are primarily in naming conventions and adding the `BelongsTo` predicate for better structure. The handling of \"professional schools\" is as explicit as possible given the lack of individual names in the source text.\n\n# Let's consider the prompt's example of a \"placeholder for actual name\" for professional schools.\n# This implies we might need to represent that there *are* professional schools.\n# The current code does not have individual predicates for the 12 professional schools.\n# However, the `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` and the explicit listing of 15 other constituents implies the existence of these 12 professional schools.\n\n# To make it more explicit, one could add a premise like:\n# ForAll x, (ProfessionalSchool(x) & BelongsTo(x, yale)) -> ConstituentUnit(x)\n# But this is redundant with `ConstituentUnit(x)` being a super-predicate.\n\n# A simpler approach to ensure the professional schools are acknowledged:\n# We can assert the existence of at least one professional school belonging to Yale.\n# Or, if we want to be specific about the *count*, it's trickier in first-order logic without auxiliary predicates or existential quantification over a collection.\n# Given the constraint to not add new sections, we'll stick to the current explicit premises.\n\n# The original program's `Constituent(x)` predicate was very general. Renaming it to `ConstituentUnit(x)` is more precise.\n# The original program had `Name(x, y)` as a general predicate, which was then used for colleges and schools. Using `CollegeName(x, y)` is more specific to the domain.\n\n# The `YearMovedTo` predicate in the original was `YearMovedTo(yale, newHaven, 1716)`. This is already quite specific and correct.\n\n# One area of potential improvement is the handling of the \"twelve professional schools.\"\n# The original code had placeholders like `Constituent(yaleSchoolOfArt)` and `Name(yaleSchoolOfArt, \"a professional school\")`. This implies creating dummy individuals.\n# The current revised program avoids creating dummy individuals for the professional schools since their names are not provided. Instead, it relies on the total count `OrganizedInto(yale, 27)` and the explicit listing of the other 15 constituents. This is a cleaner approach.\n\n# Therefore, the changes made are primarily for clarity and a more structured representation,\n# while the logic remains sound and the handling of underspecified information (professional schools) is more robust.\n# The use of `BelongsTo` clearly links constituents to Yale.\n# The predicates are more descriptive (`ConstituentUnit`, `CollegeName`).\n# The handling of the 27 units is consistent with the text.\n\n# Conclusion:\nConstituent(piersonCollege, yale) \u2227 PartOf(piersonCollege, residentialColleges)\n",

No bugs were identified that required complex fixes.\n# The handling of the 12 professional schools is as explicit as possible without individual names.\n# The logic correctly reflects the scenario.\n\n# Conclusion:\nConstituent(piersonCollege, yale) \u2227 PartOf(piersonCollege, residentialColleges)\n",

This leaves 12 for the professional schools.\n# The existence of these 12 professional schools is implicitly covered by the count '27' and the explicit listing of other components.\n# The original program did not even hint at the existence of the Graduate School or the professional schools. My proposal adds the Graduate School.\n\n# Let's assume that \"constituent colleges and schools\" implies that `College(x)` can represent both colleges and schools, and `Organized` is the predicate that ties them to `yale`.\n\n# The structure of the premises is a conjunction of clauses.\n# The goal is to provide a valid set of premises that covers the information.\n# The improved version will be:\n# - More compact by combining `College` and `Name` for residential colleges.\n# - More complete by explicitly including the `GraduateSchoolOfArtsAndSciences` and its name, as it's a named entity mentioned as a constituent part.\n# - The existence of the twelve professional schools is implicitly covered by the `Organized(yale, 27)` fact and the specific enumeration of other parts.\n\n# This seems like the most reasonable approach given the constraints.\n\n# Final check for any remaining issues:\n# - The use of `42.3billion` as a constant for `EndowmentValue` is fine as per the original program.\n# - `Year(1716)` is also fine as per the original.\n# - All other entities are constants as in the original.\n\n# The task is to produce a *different* program that *satisfies the same problem*.\n# My proposed changes make it more comprehensive and less redundant.\n# It is different in structure and content (more explicit about the Graduate School).\n# It satisfies the problem by encoding the information from the text.\n\n# The original program:\n# `College(benjaminFranklinCollege)`\n# `Name(benjaminFranklinCollege, \"Benjamin Franklin College\")`\n# This is redundant. My proposal: `College(benjaminFranklinCollege) \u2227 Name(benjaminFranklinCollege, \"Benjamin Franklin College\")`\n# This is a simplification and a fix for redundancy.\n\n# The original program misses `graduateSchoolOfArtsAndSciences`.
