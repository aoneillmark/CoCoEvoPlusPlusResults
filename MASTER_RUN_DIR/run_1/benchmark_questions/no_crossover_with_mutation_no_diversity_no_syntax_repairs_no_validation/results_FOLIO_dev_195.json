Instead of listing six distinct individuals, we now assert the existence of a tie group and then define what it means to be in a six-way tie through a universal quantification over individuals. This is a more standard way to represent such a situation.\n- The predicate `OnLeaderboard` was redundant with `Leaderboard`, so it was removed.\n- The premises related to the six-way tie were consolidated and clarified. The original premises implied that if someone was on the leaderboard, they were part of a six-way tie, which is not necessarily true for everyone on the leaderboard, only for those within the tie group. The revised premises now correctly state that there exists a tie group and that if six people are on the leaderboard, they are part of that six-way tie.\n- The premise `\u2200p (FromBelgium(p) \u2227 Leaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic) \u2192 SixWayTie(p))` was problematic because it implies that *any* Belgian on the leaderboard is in a six-way tie, which is too strong and not directly supported by the scenario. Instead, the scenario states there was *one* six-way tie and *one person* in that tie was from Belgium. The revised premises handle this by ensuring there is a Belgian on the leaderboard and that there is a six-way tie, and that at least one person from Belgium is part of *that* six-way tie. The existential quantification for `p_belgium` now correctly asserts that a Belgian is on the leaderboard. The link between being Belgian on the leaderboard and being *in* the six-way tie is implicitly handled by the existential statement about the tie group and the Belgian participant. The premise `\u2203p. (FromBelgium(p) \u2227 Leaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic))` alongside the existence of a six-way tie implies a Belgian is within a tie, which is more accurate to the problem description.\n- The universal quantification for the six-way tie was also refined. It now uses a self-conjunction of `Leaderboard(p, 1992duMaurierClassic)` to ensure that there are at least six distinct individuals satisfying this condition to form a six-way tie. This is a more explicit way to represent \"six people are on the leaderboard\".\n\n# Conclusion:\nSixWayTie(descampe) \u2227 OnLeaderboard(descampe, duMaurierClassic1992)\n",
