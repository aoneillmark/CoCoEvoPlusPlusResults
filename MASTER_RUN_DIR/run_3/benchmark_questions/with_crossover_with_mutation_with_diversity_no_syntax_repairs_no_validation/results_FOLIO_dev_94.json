If this is the case, then Tom rents if and only if this condition is true.\n\n# Let's assume the \"AllowedPet\" predicate is directly derived from the deposit condition for the purpose of Tom renting.\n# The original rule for Rent(tom, b) correctly links to AllowedPet and the deposit constraint.\n# The problem is that the rule for AllowedPet itself implies the deposit constraint.\n# This creates a redundant condition in the Rent rule.\n\n# Fix: Simplify the Rent rule. If AllowedPet(fluffy, b) is defined as ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 Pet(fluffy) \u2227 DepositAmount(b, deposit) \u2227 LessThan(deposit, 1500),\n# then the Rent rule `Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, deposit), 1500))` is saying:\n# Rent(tom, b) if and only if (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 Pet(fluffy) \u2227 DepositAmount(b, deposit) \u2227 LessThan(deposit, 1500)) AND LessThan(DepositAmount(b, deposit), 1500).\n# The `LessThan(DepositAmount(b, deposit), 1500)` is duplicated.\n\n# Let's redefine AllowedPet to be more general and then have Tom's rent condition rely on it, along with the deposit.\n# Or, even simpler, just directly state Tom's renting condition.\n\n# Simpler Approach: Directly encode Tom's renting conditions.\n# Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n# The problem states \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\" and implies that the conditions for Tom renting are the conditions for Fluffy being allowed.\n# So, let's make the \"allowed to move in with Fluffy\" part directly tied to the deposit for managed buildings.\n\n# Let's assume \"allowed to move in with Fluffy\" implies the deposit is <= 1500 for managed buildings.\n# So, Tom rents if he is in a managed building, Fluffy is his pet, and the deposit is no more than $1500.\n\n# We need to represent that \"2000$ is more than 1500$\".\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\n\n# DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 MoreThan(d, 1500) implies DepositGreaterThan1500(b)\n# DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500) implies DepositLessThan1500(b)\n# DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 EqualTo(d, 1500) implies DepositEqualTo1500(b)\n# We are given DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and MoreThan(2000, 1500)\n# This means DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and DepositGreaterThan1500(oliveGarden) is true.\n\n# Simplified Rent rule for Tom:\n# Tom rents building 'b' if 'b' is a managed building, Fluffy is his pet, and the security deposit for 'b' is less than or equal to $1500.\n# The original rule had `AllowedPet(fluffy, b)` which we can now inline or remove if it's redundant with the conditions for Tom renting.\n# Given \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\"\n# And \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\"\n# The original `AllowedPet` rule implied that if a building is managed, has a pet, and the deposit is < 1500, then the pet is allowed.\n# This means the condition for \"allowed to move in with Fluffy\" is precisely when the deposit is < 1500 in a managed building.\n\n# Therefore, the original Rent rule was essentially:\n# Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 Pet(fluffy) \u2227 DepositAmount(b, deposit) \u2227 LessThan(deposit, 1500) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, deposit), 1500))\n# Which simplifies to:\n# Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 Pet(fluffy) \u2227 DepositAmount(b, deposit) \u2227 LessThan(deposit, 1500))\n\n# Let's adjust AllowedPet to be more general if needed, but the core issue is the duplication in the Rent rule.\n# The simplest fix is to remove the redundant condition.\n\n# Redefined premises based on the above analysis:\nFluffy(fluffy)\nTom(tom)\nOliveGarden(oliveGarden)\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nCat(fluffy)\nPet(fluffy)\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\nDepositRequired(oliveGarden)\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n\n# \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# For Olive Garden, rent is 2000, and deposit is 2000.
