FavoriteSeason(x, summer) (If we add this rule as I did in an earlier draft, but it wasn't explicit in the original prompt text.)\n\n# Let's stick to the provided text's implications:\n# \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer.\"\n# \"Emma's favorite season is summer.\"\n# \"Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.\"\n# \"James wants to have a long vacation.\"\n\n# From these, we can infer:\n# 1. James loves summer (because he's a student who wants a long vacation).\n# 2. Mia's favorite season is not summer (because Emma's is summer, and Mia's is different).\n\n# The original program had this premise:\n# \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, s))\n# This is equivalent to saying \"For any season s, if Emma's favorite is s, then Mia's favorite is not s.\"\n# Coupled with FavoriteSeason(emma, summer), it correctly implies \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer).\n\n# The original program had this premise:\n# \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acs = Summer)\n# This is problematic, as discussed. It implies Emma's favorite cannot be Summer.\n\n# The original program had this premise:\n# FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2192 \u00acs = Summer\n# This means \"If Mia's favorite season is s, then s is not Summer.\"\n# This is a more direct way to state \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer) if we only care about the specific fact.\n# However, this is an implication that still requires 's' to be existentially quantified or bound.\n# A simpler way is to directly state the negation: \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer).\n\n# Let's try to reproduce the intent of the original, but fix the bugs.\n\n# Bugs identified:\n# 1. \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acs = Summer) contradicts FavoriteSeason(emma, Summer).\n# 2.

The simplification comes from removing the contradictory premise and directly stating the implication for Mia.\n\n# Final check on vocabulary and format.\n# All vocabulary from the original is kept.\n# Format is correct with # Premises.\n# No extra sections.\n\n# One last thought: should we infer that if something is *not* a favorite season, it cannot be loved? The prompt doesn't state this.\n# The prompt also doesn't state that only students can want long vacations, but the rule is limited to students.\n\n# Let's review the original premises and my proposed fix.\n# Original:\n# FavoriteSeason(emma, Summer)\n# \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, Summer))\n# \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, s))\n# \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acs = Summer)  <-- BUG\n# FavoriteSeason(mia, s) \u2192 \u00acs = Summer\n\n# My fix:\n# FavoriteSeason(emma, summer)\n# \u2200x (Student(x) \u2227 WantsLongVacation(x) \u2192 Loves(x, summer))\n# \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer)\n\n# The premise \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, s)) is logically equivalent to saying \"There is no season 's' such that Emma's favorite is 's' AND Mia's favorite is also 's'\".\n# Combined with FavoriteSeason(emma, summer), it means there is no season 's' such that 's' is Summer AND Mia's favorite is 's'. This is precisely \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer).\n# So, the original premise \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, s)) implicitly covers the \"Mia's favorite is not the same as Emma's\" aspect once Emma's favorite is known.\n\n# However, the prompt asks for fixing bugs, adding edge cases, or simplifying logic.\n# The direct statement \u00acFavoriteSeason(mia, summer) is simpler and directly reflects the derived fact.\n# The premise \u2200s (FavoriteSeason(emma, s) \u2192 \u00acs = Summer) is the main bug.\n\n# Let's ensure the season names are consistent (Spring vs spring). The original used capitalized versions. I'll use lowercase to match constants.\n\n# The original uses `Year(y)` and `HasSeason(x, y)`. I've used a constant `this_year`.
