So, `German(german)` implies that the constant `german` satisfies the predicate `German`.\n# And thus, `Related(german, spanish)` is derived.\n\n# The current setup seems to correctly capture the scenario.\n# The key difference is making the named entities explicit constants and ensuring their properties are asserted.\n\n# Re-considering the Basque premise:\n# `\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u2200y (Language(y) \u2227 \u00acBasque(y) \u2192 \u00acRelated(x, y)))`\n# If `basque` is a constant, and `Basque(basque)` is true, then this implies:\n# `\u2200y (Language(y) \u2227 \u00acBasque(y) \u2192 \u00acRelated(basque, y))`\n# This means `basque` is not related to any language that is not `basque`. This is correct.\n\n# The problem description implies \"French and Spanish are both Romance languages\" as facts about these specific languages.\n# So, the direct assertions `RomanceLanguage(french)` and `RomanceLanguage(spanish)` are appropriate.\n# Similarly, \"German is related to Spanish\" should imply a direct relationship.\n# And \"Basque is not related to any other language\".\n\n# The original program:\n# \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(x))\n# LanguageFamily(romance_family)\n# \u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 BelongsToFamily(x, romance_family))\n# \u2200x \u2200y (BelongsToFamily(x, romance_family) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(y, romance_family) \u2192 Related(x, y))\n# RomanceLanguage(french)\n# RomanceLanguage(spanish)\n# \u2200x (German(x) \u2192 Related(x, spanish))\n# \u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u2200y (Language(y) \u2227 \u00acBasque(y) \u2192 \u00acRelated(x, y)))\n\n# My proposed changes:\n# 1.

If `german` is a constant for German, and `spanish` for Spanish, then the direct assertion `Related(german, spanish)` is more explicit and simpler than using a quantified rule if the rule is only meant for these specific instances.\n# However, the original program used `\u2200x (German(x) \u2192 Related(x, spanish))`. This implies that if there were other things that could be German (which there aren't, as German is a specific language), they'd also be related.\n# To keep a similar structure but ensure the constant `german` is covered:\n# Assert `German(german)`. Then `German(german) \u2192 Related(german, spanish)` derived from the original rule.\n# This makes the original rule work with the constants.\n\n# Let's assume that `French`, `Spanish`, `German`, `Basque` are also constants, like `french`, `spanish`, `german`, `basque`.\n# The original uses `French(x)` as a predicate.
