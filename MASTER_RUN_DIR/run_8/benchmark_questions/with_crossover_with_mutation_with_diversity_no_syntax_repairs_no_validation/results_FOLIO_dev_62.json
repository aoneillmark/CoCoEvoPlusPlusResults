This is simpler and more direct than the universally quantified version.\n# It also doesn't impose the CPT requirement on non-international students named Mike,\n# which is more consistent with the overall problem description focusing on international students.\n# If the original intent was that any Mike needs CPT if they work, irrespective of their status,\n# then the original premise was arguably correct. But if the intent is to be consistent with the scenario,\n# making it specific to Mike *as* an international student might be better.\n# The prompt asks to \"simplify logic\".

If Mike had a J1 visa, this rule would be relevant, but the scenario doesn't provide information about J1 visa holders' work applications. The specific rule for Mike covers his case more directly.\n# - Removed `\u2200x (Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))`: This rule was too general and not sufficiently constrained by the scenario information (e.g., it didn't specify the student must be in the US or have a visa).\n# - Clarified the F1 visa rule to state CPT *or* OPT, as per the scenario's wording. The original encoding was incorrect here.\n# - Added a specific rule for Mike's need to apply for CPT if he wants to work, as stated in the scenario. This ensures his specific requirement is captured. If Mike has an F1 visa, this is consistent with needing CPT or OPT, and explicitly states he *does* need CPT.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",

It doesn't say \"Mike *with an F1 visa* needs to apply for CPT\".\n# This suggests the CPT requirement for Mike is independent of his visa type, or it implies he has an F1 implicitly.\n\n# To fix potential ambiguity: explicitly state Mike's need for CPT is the key if he wants to work.\n# The original formulation is actually quite good at capturing this.\n\n# Let's consider simplifying the logic.\n# The first two general rules are fine.\n# The specific rule for Mike is `Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`.\n# This is clean.\n\n# What if Mike doesn't want to work?

It's a general rule for Mike that is always true when he wants to work.\n# 2. It's a specific scenario for Mike implying CPT is the *only* option.\n# Given the existing rules, the most straightforward interpretation is that Mike has a specific requirement for CPT.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa, wants to work, and the rule \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work\" implies CPT is a requirement regardless of other visa holders, then we can enforce it.\n# However, to simplify and avoid redundancy, and assuming the general F1 rule is sufficient, we can rephrase this to capture the direct implication for Mike.\n# If we assume the original intent was that Mike *specifically* needs CPT (and not OPT, or at least CPT is a necessary condition for him when working), we can make this more explicit.\n# Considering \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" and Mike has F1 and wants to work, this implies NeedsToApplyForCPT(mike) is true.\n# Let's refine this to ensure it correctly captures the scenario and avoids contradiction or redundancy with the general F1 rule.\n# The statement is a conditional: WantsToWork(x) -> NeedsToApplyForCPT(x).\n# Since Mike WantsToWork(mike), then NeedsToApplyForCPT(mike) must hold.\n# This can be a separate rule for Mike.\n# For simplicity and to directly address \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\", we can assert this directly for Mike given he wants to work.\n# However, the prompt asks to simplify logic and fix bugs/edge cases. The previous formulation of this rule as \"\u2200x (WantsToWork(x) \u2192 NeedsToApplyForCPT(x))\" is very broad.\n# A more precise interpretation tied to the scenario is that *if* Mike wants to work, he needs CPT.\n# Given Mike wants to work, and he's an international student in the US with an F1 visa, the general rule for F1 students already states he needs CPT or OPT.\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" could be seen as an additional constraint on Mike.\n# To simplify and adhere to the F1 rule: if Mike has F1 and wants to work, he needs CPT OR OPT.\n# The statement about Mike needing CPT can be interpreted as a specific outcome for Mike.\n# Given HasF1Visa(mike) and WantsToWork(mike), the general rule applies.\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is a direct implication.\n# Let's make it more direct and specific to Mike's situation, ensuring it doesn't conflict but rather reinforces.\n# If Mike wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT. This is a direct implication.\nWantsToWork(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApplyForCPT(mike)\n\n# Clarification: The previous formulation `\u2200x (WantsToWork(x) \u2192 NeedsToApplyForCPT(x))` implies that *any* student (even without an F1 visa) would need CPT if they wanted to work, which might be incorrect. The prompt mentions simplifying logic. Given Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he *must* apply for CPT or OPT. The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" can be interpreted as a specific requirement for Mike. By making it `WantsToWork(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApplyForCPT(mike)`, we are stating that *if* Mike wants to work, CPT is a necessary application for him. This aligns with the scenario and doesn't over-generalize.\n\n# The original program had a comment about J1 visa holders:\n# \"# The original premise \"\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 J1Visa(x)) \u2192 (\u00acNeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2227 \u00acNeedsToApply(x, OPT())))\" is implicitly covered...\"\n# To explicitly cover the case that J1 visa holders don't require CPT/OPT under the F1 rules, we can add:\n\u2200x ((IsStudent(x) \u2227 InUS(x) \u2227 HasJ1Visa(x)) \u2192 (\u00acNeedsToApplyForCPT(x) \u2227 \u00acNeedsToApplyForOPT(x)))\n# This makes the logic for J1 visa holders explicit and avoids ambiguity.\n# This rule ensures that if someone has a J1 visa and is an international student in the US, they are not subject to the CPT/OPT requirements that apply to F1 visa holders. This addresses potential edge cases where a solver might incorrectly infer CPT/OPT needs for J1 holders without this explicit constraint.\n# This also simplifies the logic by clearly delineating the requirements for different visa types.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
