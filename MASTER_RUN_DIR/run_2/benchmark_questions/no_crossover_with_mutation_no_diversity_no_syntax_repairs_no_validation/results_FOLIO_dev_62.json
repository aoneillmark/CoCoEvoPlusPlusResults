This is not explicitly stated and seems to override the F1/J1 distinction. The context focuses heavily on F1. Therefore, removing this rule and relying on visa-specific rules is a simplification and bug fix.\n\n# The core problem is fixing the AND to OR for F1 students, and then ensuring Mike's specific condition is met.\n\n# So, the premises will be:\n# Facts about Mike.\n# General visa rule.\n# Corrected F1 rule (with OR).\n# Specific rule for Mike.\n\n# This addresses the bugs (AND to OR) and ensures the specific statement about Mike is encoded.\n\n\n# Original Program's Rules:\n# R1: \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n# R2: \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# R3: \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n# R4: \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\n# Bugs:\n# - R2 and R3 together imply AND. Problem statement says \"CPT or OPT\".\n# - R4 is overly general and might be incorrect if J1 students don't need CPT.\n\n# Missing/Ambiguous:\n# - The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" is a specific conditional for Mike. It's not fully captured by the general rules, especially with the AND bug.\n\n# New Program:\n# Facts about Mike (same as original).\n# R1 (same as original).\n# Corrected F1 rule: R2' = \u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())))\n# Specific rule for Mike: R5 = Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# This seems to be the most robust solution.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",

CPT is a specific work authorization for F1 students.\n\nThe corrected approach focuses on the specific conditions for international students.\n\n# Revised Premises:\nInternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Person(mike)\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 (F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)))\n# Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n# This implies that the conditions for CPT application are met if he wants to work.\n# The previous logic was overly broad.\n\u2200x (Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n# We can infer that if Mike wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT\n# given the scenario's statement about Mike.\nWork(mike)\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
