The previous axiom might have allowed a person to gain something that wasn't knowledge,\n# which would then not lead to them becoming smarter according to the next axiom.\n# The axiom about becoming smarter remains the same, as it correctly links gaining *knowledge* to becoming smarter.\n# The core facts remain unchanged as they are specific instances within the scenario.\n# No new edge cases were introduced, and the existing ones were handled by the specific nature of the predicates and quantifiers.\n# The logic is simplified by making the gained item explicit as knowledge when reading a book.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2200x (Smarter(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Gains(x, y)))\n",
