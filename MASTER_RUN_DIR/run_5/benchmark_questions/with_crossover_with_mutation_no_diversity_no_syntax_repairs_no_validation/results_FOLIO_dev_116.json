The rule `\u2200x ((Class(x) \u2227 Man(x) \u2227 \u00ac(x = Michael)) \u2192 Taller(Michael, x))` handles this. If there are no such `x`, the premise is vacuously true.\n# What if Michael is not a man? The blocking rules require `Man(x)`.\n# What if Peter is not a man? The blocking rule involving Peter would not apply.\n# What if Windy is not a man? The blocking rule involving Windy would not apply.\n# The original code had `Man(michael)` and `Man(peter)`. It did not explicitly state `Man(windy)`.\n# However, the statement \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" implies Windy is a target of blocking.\n# The primary blocking rule is `\u2200x \u2200y ((Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y)) \u2192 Block(x, y))`.\n# If Michael is taller than Windy, and Man(Michael), Man(Windy), then Block(Michael, Windy).\n# But we have `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)`. This implies either Michael is not taller than Windy, or one of them is not a man.\n# Given `Man(Michael)`, it must be that either `\u00acTaller(Michael, Windy)` or `\u00acMan(Windy)`.\n# The scenario implicitly suggests Windy is a person that Michael might interact with.\n# If the rule \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" is absolute, and Michael is a man, and if Michael were taller than Windy (and Windy a man), he *would* block her.\n# The fact that he *cannot* block her shooting, given `Man(Michael)`, implies either `\u00acMan(Windy)` OR `\u00acTaller(Michael, Windy)`.\n# However, the problem statement says \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\". It doesn't give a reason.\n# The rule `\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x)) \u2192 Block(michael, x))` is one way Michael can block.\n# The rule `\u2200x \u2200y ((Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y)) \u2192 Block(x, y))` is another.\n# Given `Man(Michael)` and `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)`, it means that IF Michael were to block Windy based on height, that rule must not apply.\n# This means either `\u00acMan(Windy)` OR `\u00acTaller(Michael, Windy)`.\n# Let's assume `Man(Windy)` is required for the first blocking rule to be relevant.\n# If `Man(Windy)` is true, then `\u00acTaller(Michael, Windy)` must be true for `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)` to be consistent with the height-based blocking.\n# Let's re-evaluate the implications of `Man(Windy)`.\n# The problem states: \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.\"\n# If `Man(Michael)` and `Man(Windy)` and `Taller(Michael, Windy)`, then `Block(Michael, Windy)` would be true from the first rule.\n# But `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)` is given.\n# This forces us to conclude that at least one of the conditions for the first rule must be false if Michael and Windy are involved.\n# So, either `\u00acMan(Michael)` (false, given Man(Michael)), OR `\u00acMan(Windy)`, OR `\u00acTaller(Michael, Windy)`.\n# If we assume `Man(Windy)` is true, then `\u00acTaller(Michael, Windy)`.\n# If we don't assume `Man(Windy)`, then the first blocking rule doesn't directly apply.\n# The scenario states: \"Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.\" \"Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.\"\n# These statements focus on men.\n# The rule \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" is a specific exception.\n# It is possible that the problem implies Windy is a person who is not a man, and thus the height-based blocking rule doesn't apply to her, but the exception `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)` is still there.\n# However, if Windy is a shooter, and Michael *can't* block her, it's a bit of a puzzle.\n# The most direct interpretation is that `Man(Windy)` is NOT necessarily true.\n# If `Man(Windy)` is not true, then `\u2200x \u2200y ((Man(x) \u2227 Man(y) \u2227 Taller(x, y)) \u2192 Block(x, y))` does not apply if `y` is Windy.\n\n# Let's assume Windy is a person, Shooter, but not necessarily a Man.\n# The statement \"Michael cannot block Windy's shooting\" might be a standalone fact.\n\n# Premises:\nPerson(x)\nMan(x)\nTaller(x, y)\nBlock(x, y)\nShooting(y)\nClass(x)\nJump(x)\nGreatShooter(x)\nShooter(x)\n\nMichael\nPeter\nWindy\n\n# Axioms and Properties of Individuals\nMan(Michael)\nMan(Peter)\n\n# Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.\n# This means for any person 'x' in Michael's class, if 'x' is not Michael, then Michael is taller than 'x'.\n# We also need 'x' to be a Man for the height-based blocking rule.\n\u2200x ((Class(x) \u2227 Man(x) \u2227 \u00ac(x = Michael)) \u2192 Taller(Michael, x))\n\n# Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.\nMan(Peter)\nTaller(Peter, Michael)\n\n# Transitivity of Taller relation.\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (Taller(x, y) \u2227 Taller(y, z) \u2192 Taller(x, z))\n\n# Blocking conditions:\n# 1.

It only states that Michael and Peter are men.\n# The rule `\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x)) \u2192 Block(Michael, x))` applies to any person `x`.\n# If Windy is a shooter and does not jump, then Michael *should* be able to block her shooting by this rule.\n# But `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)` is given. This is a contradiction if Windy is a non-jumping shooter.\n# This implies Windy must be a jumping shooter, OR the rule `\u2200x ((Shooter(x) \u2227 \u00acJump(x)) \u2192 Block(Michael, x))` needs to be considered in conjunction with `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)`.\n# The simplest resolution is that the exception `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)` overrides any general rule.\n# If Windy is a shooter and does not jump, then Michael *would* block her, UNLESS explicitly stated otherwise.\n# So, the fact `\u00acBlock(Michael, Windy)` exists means that regardless of whether she jumps or not, Michael cannot block her.\n\n# Let's re-state premises to be as close as possible while fixing issues.\n# The main issue was the interpretation of \"Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.\"\n# The original rule `\u2200x (Man(michael) \u2227 Taller(michael, x) \u2192 Class(x))` was backwards.\n\n# Revised set of premises:\n\n# Conclusion:\nBlock(peter, windy)\n",
