changes and sticking to existing predicates if possible.\n\n# Let's make a more direct interpretation of the problematic premise's intent:\n# Tom rents if allowed Fluffy AND (deposit < 1500 OR deposit

problematic because `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` asserts the deposit *is* 1500.\n# So `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` is always false.\n\n# Let's assume that \"no more than $1500\" means strictly less than $1500, due to the presence of `LessThan`.\n# If that's the case, then `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` is still a contradiction if `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` means the deposit is 1500.\n# It is more likely `DepositAmount(x, d)` where `d` is the deposit and the condition should be `LessThan(d, 1500)`.\n\n# Let's assume the problem meant to establish a specific deposit amount for Olive Garden that satisfies the conditions.\n# However, no such amount is given.\n\n# We need to correct the condition related to deposit amount for Tom to rent.\n# Let's assume `LessThanOrEqual(d, 1500)` is implied and we can express it using the given predicates, if possible.\n# `DepositAmount(x, d)` means the deposit for `x` is `d`.\n# We need `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x)

deposit amount is specified, we use that.\n# If we interpret `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` as a way to *check* if the deposit is 1500, and `LessThan` is a strict comparison.\n# Then the condition `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` is always false.\n\n# Alternative fix: Rephrase the condition using a variable for the deposit amount and the LessThan predicate, combined with an Equality check if possible.\n# If `EqualTo(a, b)` is implicitly available via `=`, or if we can infer it.\n# Let's assume `EqualTo(a, b)` is implicitly available for numerical values.\n# Then `no more than 1500` is `LessThan(d, 1500) \u2228 EqualTo(d, 1500)`.\n\n# The current program uses `2000$ is more than $1500.` which is `MoreThan(2000, 1500)`.\n# This suggests `MoreThan(a, b)` and `LessThan(b, a)`

bug is the `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` clause.\n\n# Proposed fix:\n# Let's assume `DepositAmount(x, y)` means the deposit for x is y.\n# The condition \"no more than $1500\" is `deposit <= 1500`.\n# We can represent this as `deposit < 1500 OR deposit = 1500`.\n# If we must use `LessThan`, and we don't have `EqualTo` for amounts:\n# The original statement is likely trying to say:

condition to avoid the problematic `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` part, and instead assert the condition about the deposit limit.\n# The scenario states: \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\"\n# This implies a condition on `DepositAmount`.\n\n# Let's remove the faulty `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)` and replace it with a correct existential statement.\n# However, the prompt asks to *edit* the program, not to add new complex clauses with `\u2203`.\n\n#
