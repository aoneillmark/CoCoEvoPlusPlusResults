The implication `\u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))` would mean \"for any `x`, if `x` is the language French, then `x` is a Romance language\". This is true if `French` is a constant that represents that language.\n\n# Let's assume the original intent was for French, Spanish, German, Basque, and RomanceFamily to be constants (unique identifiers).\n# In that case, `RomanceLanguage(French)` is a direct assertion.\n# `\u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))` becomes `French(French) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(French)`.\n# If `French` is a constant, then `French(x)` is true only when `x` is that constant.\n# So `French(French)` is true. The premise then becomes `True \u2192 RomanceLanguage(French)`, which is `RomanceLanguage(French)`.\n# This means `\u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))` is redundant if `French` is a constant and `RomanceLanguage(French)` is asserted.\n\n# Revised Premises (assuming constants for named languages and RomanceFamily):\nRomanceFamily := RomanceFamily  # Explicitly declare RomanceFamily as a constant if not already.\nFrench := French\nSpanish := Spanish\nGerman := German\nBasque := Basque\n\n\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(x))\n\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 BelongsToFamily(x, RomanceFamily))\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (BelongsToFamily(x, y) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(z, y) \u2192 Related(x, z))\n\u2200x \u2200y (Related(x, y) \u2192 Related(y, x))  # Symmetry of Related\nRomanceLanguage(French)\nRomanceLanguage(Spanish)\nRelated(German, Spanish)\n\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u2200y (Related(x, y) \u2192 x = y)) # Basque is not related to any *other* language\n\u2200x (German(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n\u2200x (IndoEuropeanLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n# These are now explicit assertions for the constants:\nBelongsToFamily(French, RomanceFamily)\nBelongsToFamily(Spanish, RomanceFamily)\n\n# The original program had:\n# RomanceLanguage(French)\n# RomanceLanguage(Spanish)\n# BelongsToFamily(French, RomanceFamily)\n# BelongsToFamily(Spanish, RomanceFamily)\n# These are direct assertions.\n\n# Let's stick to a minimal set that captures the scenario and fixes any perceived issues.\n# The main potential bug or missing edge case: Symmetry of `Related`.\n# The simplification is removing the redundant `\u2200x (French(x) \u2192 RomanceLanguage(x))` if `French` is a constant and `RomanceLanguage(French)` is asserted.\n\n# Final proposed program:\n\n# Premises:\n\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(x))\n\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 BelongsToFamily(x, RomanceFamily))\n\u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (BelongsToFamily(x, y) \u2227 BelongsToFamily(z, y) \u2192 Related(x, z))\n\u2200x \u2200y (Related(x, y) \u2192 Related(y, x))  # Added: Symmetry of Related predicate\nRomanceLanguage(French)\nRomanceLanguage(Spanish)\nRelated(German, Spanish)\n\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u2200y (Related(x, y) \u2192 x = y)) # Simplified Basque premise to be more direct\n\u2200x (German(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n\u2200x (RomanceLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x))\n\u2200x (IndoEuropeanLanguage(x) \u2192 Language(x))\nBelongsToFamily(French, RomanceFamily) # Explicitly stated in scenario description for French and Spanish\nBelongsToFamily(Spanish, RomanceFamily) # Explicitly stated in scenario description for French and Spanish\n\n# Conclusion:\nRomanceLanguage(french) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(french)\n",
