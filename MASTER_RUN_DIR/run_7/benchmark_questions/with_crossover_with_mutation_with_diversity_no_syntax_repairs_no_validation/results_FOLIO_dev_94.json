(Premise)\n# The security deposit at Olive Garden is $2000.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# $2000 is more than $1500. (Premise)\n# This implies DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) if RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# The premise DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is asserted directly in the original.\nDepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden).\n# This premise asserts that Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden. This might be a consequence of a general rule or a specific fact.\n# Given the original rules, it's likely intended as a fact.\nAllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden).\n# DepositRequired(oliveGarden) is also asserted directly.\nDepositRequired(oliveGarden).\n# We also need to establish the relationship between the deposit amount and one month's rent.\n# Since RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) and DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000), then DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) is true.\nDepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden).\n# This implies that the deposit is not \"more than\" one month's rent in the sense of being strictly greater if it's equal.\n# However, the original has both DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) and MoreThan(2000, 1500).\n# Let's resolve this by stating the deposit is equal to one month's rent, and that 2000 is indeed >= 1500.\n# The original stated `MoreThan(2000, 1500)` and `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden)`.\n# If rent is 2000 and deposit is 2000, then the deposit is *equal to* one month's rent.\n# The original premises seem to have a slight contradiction or ambiguity if DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) means strictly greater.\n# Let's refine the interpretation of deposit rules to be explicit.\n# Revised rule to handle the deposit amount condition more directly, considering \"no more than $1500\" for renting.\n\n# To ensure the Rent(tom, x) condition can be evaluated, we need to make sure Fluffy is allowed in Olive Garden if it's a managed building and Tom wants to rent.\n# The original rule \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x)) seems to imply this.\n# We will keep this rule, but interpret it as a general principle.\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x)).\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",

Rent is 2000.\n# So for Olive Garden, deposit is 2000 OR deposit > 2000. In both cases, deposit > 1500.\n# Thus, DepositNoMoreThan1500(oliveGarden) is false.\n# Therefore, Rent(tom, oliveGarden) is false.\n\n# Let's simplify the deposit predicate system.\n# Instead of DepositEqualToOneMonthRent and DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent,\n# let's directly assert the amount for Olive Garden.\n\n# New approach:\n# Premises:\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\nFluffy(fluffy)\nTom(tom)\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nCat(fluffy)\n\n# General Rules:\n\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 DepositRequired(x))\n\n# Deposit constraint for managed buildings:\n# The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\n# This means for a managed building x, if there's a deposit d, then d >= RentAmount(x, r) for some r.\n# For Olive Garden, RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000).\n# So, DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2192 d >= 2000.\n\n# Tom's renting condition:\n# Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy,\n# and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203d (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 MoreThan(d, 1500)))))\n\n# Now we need to state facts about Olive Garden's deposit.\n# Based on \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\" AND RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000):\n# DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) OR \u2203d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 MoreThan(d, 2000)).\n# In both cases, any deposit amount for Olive Garden is MORE THAN 1500.\n# So, we can directly state:\n\u2200d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2192 MoreThan(d, 1500))\n\n# This implies \u00ac\u2203d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 MoreThan(d, 1500)) is false.\n# Therefore, Rent(tom, oliveGarden) is false.\n\n# What about AllowedPet? The scenario doesn't provide enough information to assert AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden).\n# The original program had \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x)) which was too strong and likely incorrect given \"some managed buildings\".\n# Let's assume that for Tom to even CONSIDER renting, AllowedPet must be true.\n# The current formulation \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 DepositNoMoreThan1500(x)))) is correct.\n\n# The key is to correctly deduce that Olive Garden's deposit is > 1500.\n# From scenario: \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# For Olive Garden: Rent is 2000.\n# So deposit must be 2000 OR > 2000.\n# In both cases, deposit is > 1500.\n\n# Let's formalize this deduction.\n# 1. ManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\n# 2. RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# 3. \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 DepositRequired(x)) => DepositRequired(oliveGarden)\n# 4. \u2200x (DepositRequired(x) \u2192 (\u2203r (RentAmount(x, r)) \u2227 (\u2203d (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 (d = r \u2228 d > r)))))\n#    Applying this to Olive Garden:\n#    \u2203r (RentAmount(oliveGarden, r))  (which is true, r=2000)\n#    AND (\u2203d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 (d = 2000 \u2228 d > 2000)))\n#    This means that if DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d), then (d = 2000 or d > 2000).\n#    In both cases, MoreThan(d, 1500).\n#    So, \u2200d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2192 MoreThan(d, 1500)).\n\n# 5. Tom's condition: \u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203d (DepositAmount(x, d) \u2227 MoreThan(d, 1500)))))\n#    Applying to Olive Garden:\n#    Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 MoreThan(d, 1500)))\n#    From step 4, \u2200d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2192 MoreThan(d, 1500)).\n#    This implies \u00ac\u2203d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 MoreThan(d, 1500)) is FALSE.\n#    So, Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 False)\n#    Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 False\n#    Therefore, \u00acRent(tom, oliveGarden).\n\n# This looks consistent. The original program had some redundant predicates and rules that were either not directly inferable or created contradictions.\n\n# Let's simplify the predicate usage for clarity.\n# Instead of DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent, we can directly use the implication.\n\n# New Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",
