WellAttended(w) means wedding w is well-attended.\n\n# Let's consolidate and ensure no redundancy or misinterpretation.\n\n# Redundant rule from original program:\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p) \u2192 \u00acTravelsToParis(p))\n# This is implied by the first rule: Person(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p) \u2192 HasChild(p)\n# And the rule: Person(p) \u2227 HasChild(p) \u2192 \u00acTravelsToParis(p)\n# So, Person(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p) \u2192 HasChild(p) \u2192 \u00acTravelsToParis(p)\n# This means the rule is redundant. We will remove it for simplification.\n\n# Corrected interpretation of the last rule for John:\n# \"If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# This is equivalent to: If John has a well-attended wedding 'w', then WeddingInJuly(w) OR TravelsToParis(John).\n# Original rule was: \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 John(p) \u2192 (HasWedding(p) \u2192 OccursInJuly(w) \u2228 TravelsToParis(p))) - this was an attempt to fix.\n# The last rule in original program was: \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 John(p) \u2192 \u00ac(HasWedding(p) \u2227 WellAttended(w))) - this was a bug/misinterpretation.\n# The rule that seems intended for John specifically is:\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 John(p) \u2227 HasWedding(p) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(w) \u2228 TravelsToParis(p)) -- This requires a specific wedding w.\n# The best fit for \"John has a wedding that is well-attended\" is if there exists *a* wedding 'w' such that BelongsTo(w, John) and WellAttended(w).\n# So:\n\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 John(p) \u2227 \u2203w (Wedding(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 WellAttended(w)) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(w) \u2228 TravelsToParis(p))\n# Note: The 'w' here should be existential, but standard FOL requires 'w' to be universally quantified if it's not bound.\n# A clearer way to write this is:\n# For all persons p, if p is John, and there exists a wedding w such that w belongs to p and w is well-attended,\n# THEN it must be the case that *that same wedding* w is in July OR p travels to Paris.\n# This implies we need to link the existential 'w' from the premise to the conclusion.\n# Let's simplify: If John has *a* well-attended wedding, then that wedding is in July OR John travels to Paris.\n# The simplest form using the existing predicates is to use the general rule for well-attended weddings that apply to any person.\n# The rule: \u2200p \u2200w (Person(p) \u2227 Wedding(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 WellAttended(w) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(w) \u2228 TravelsToParis(p))\n# This rule applies to John as well. The specific statement about John might be redundant or need a stronger statement.\n# Let's re-examine: \"If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# This structure \"if not, then\" implies a conditional.\n# Case 1: John has a well-attended wedding 'w', and 'w' is in July. (Satisfied)\n# Case 2: John has a well-attended wedding 'w', and 'w' is NOT in July. Then John travels to Paris.\n# This is exactly what the rule: \u2200p \u2200w (Person(p) \u2227 Wedding(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 WellAttended(w) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(w) \u2228 TravelsToParis(p)) states.\n# So, the general rule seems to cover the John case.\n\n# Final consideration of the original program's last rule:\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 John(p) \u2192 \u00ac(HasWedding(p) \u2227 WellAttended(w)))\n# This is problematic because 'w' is not bound. It's likely a typo.
