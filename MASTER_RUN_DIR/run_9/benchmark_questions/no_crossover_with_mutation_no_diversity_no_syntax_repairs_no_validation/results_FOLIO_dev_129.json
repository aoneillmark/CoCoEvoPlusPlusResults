Let's stick to `OccursInJuly(w)`.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the rule: \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# \u2200w (OccursInJuly(w) \u2192 \u2203p (BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 TravelsToParis(p))) - This seems correct.\n\n# Now consider the last rule: `BelongsTo(wedding, john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(wedding) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(wedding)`\n# If we treat `WeddingInJuly(x)` as a synonym for `OccursInJuly(x)`:\n# `BelongsTo(w, john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w) \u2192 OccursInJuly(w)` - This is a tautology.\n\n# Let's consider the possibility that `WeddingInJuly(x)` in the original was meant to be applied to *people*.\n# \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# This is still ambiguous. Let's assume the predicate `WeddingInJuly(x)` was a mistake in the prompt and `OccursInJuly(w)` is the correct predicate for weddings.\n\n# Let's re-examine the rule: \"If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# Original: `HasWedding(john) \u2227 WellAttended(wedding) \u2192 OccursInJuly(wedding) \u2228 \u00acTravelsToParis(john)`\n# This is problematic. `HasWedding(john)` is a property of John, `WellAttended(wedding)` is a property of a wedding. How are they linked?\n# It should likely be: If John has a wedding `w` and `w` is well-attended, then `w` occurs in July OR John travels to Paris.\n# Let's assume `Wedding(w)` and `BelongsTo(w, john)`.\n\u2200w \u2200p (IsJohn(p) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 WellAttended(w) \u2192 OccursInJuly(w) \u2228 TravelsToParis(p))\n# This is what was added above.\n\n# The last premise from original: `BelongsTo(wedding, john) \u2227 OccursInJuly(wedding) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(wedding)`\n# Given the ambiguity, and that `OccursInJuly` is the established predicate for weddings, let's remove this premise as it's either tautological or implies a meaning for `WeddingInJuly` not otherwise defined or used consistently.\n\n# Let's review and potentially simplify the predicates and rules.\n# Current predicates: Person(x), HasWedding(x), HasChild(x), TravelsToParis(x), Wedding(w), OccursInJuly(w), WellAttended(w), BelongsTo(w, p), IsJohn(p).\n# This seems reasonably clean.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\"\n# \u2200w (OccursInJuly(w) \u2192 \u2203p (BelongsTo(w, p) \u2227 TravelsToParis(p)))\n# This is correct.\n\n# Consider the implications of the first few rules:\n# 1. \u2200p (HasWedding(p) \u2192 HasChild(p))\n# 2. \u2200p (TravelsToParis(p) \u2192 HasWedding(p))\n# Combining 1 and 2: \u2200p (TravelsToParis(p) \u2192 HasWedding(p) \u2192 HasChild(p))\n# So, \u2200p (TravelsToParis(p) \u2192 HasChild(p))\n\n# Re-writing the John specific rule:\n# 3. \u2200p (IsJohn(p) \u2192 (HasChild(p) \u2192 (\u00acTravelsToParis(p) \u2227 \u00acHasWedding(p))))\n# If John has a child, he doesn't travel to Paris and doesn't have a wedding.\n# This means if John has a child, then it's NOT the case that John travels to Paris (and thus not the case he has a wedding).\n# Using contrapositive of TravelToParis -> HasWedding: \u00acHasWedding(p) -> \u00acTravelsToParis(p)\n# From rule 3: HasChild(john) -> \u00acTravelsToParis(john).\n# And also: HasChild(john) -> \u00acHasWedding(john).\n\n# Let's check if the old predicates `HasWedding(x, y)` and `WeddingInJuly(x)` were indeed problematic.\n# `HasWedding(x, y)` ::: x has wedding y. This is better than just `HasWedding(x)` if we need to link people to specific weddings.\n# However, the problem describes properties of *people* (have wedding, have child, travel to Paris) and properties of *weddings* (occur in July, well-attended).\n# The `BelongsTo(w, p)` predicate links weddings to people.\n# So, `HasWedding(p)` can be defined as `\u2203w (BelongsTo(w, p))`.\n\n# Let's use the `BelongsTo` relation and make `HasWedding(p)` a derived property.\n# If we do that, then rule 1: `\u2200p (\u2203w (BelongsTo(w, p)) \u2192 HasChild(p))`\n# This changes the meaning. The original stated \"All people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child.\"\n# If \"have a wedding\" means \"has a wedding event\", then `HasWedding(p)` means `\u2203w BelongsTo(w,p)`.\n\n# Let's try to refine the predicates to be more explicit and resolve the ambiguity.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac(\u2203w (Wedding(w) \u2227 WellAttended(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, john))) \u2227 \u00acTravelsToParis(john)\n",
