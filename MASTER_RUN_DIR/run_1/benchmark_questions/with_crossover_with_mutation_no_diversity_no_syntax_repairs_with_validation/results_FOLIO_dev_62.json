It implied that any international student in the US wanting to work needs CPT,\n# regardless of visa type or the need for CPT/OPT distinction.\n# The revised program prioritizes the explicit statements about F1 visa holders needing CPT or OPT,\n# and the specific requirement for Mike to apply for CPT if he wants to work.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa, wants to work, he falls under Rule 2, needing CPT or OPT.\n# Rule 3 then specifically states he needs CPT. This is consistent.\n# If Mike didn't have an F1 visa but still wanted to work, Rule 3 would still apply,\n# but the rules about F1 visa holders needing CPT/OPT wouldn't.\n# The phrasing \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" can be seen as a direct specification for Mike.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
