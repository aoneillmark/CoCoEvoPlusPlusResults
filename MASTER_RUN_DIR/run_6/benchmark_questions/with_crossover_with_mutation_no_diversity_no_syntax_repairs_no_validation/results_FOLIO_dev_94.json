deposit is implicitly tied to the rent.\n# Since 2000 is more than 1500, and the deposit can be equal to or more than one month's rent,\n# and the specific rent is 2000, the deposit amount for Olive Garden must be at least 2000.\n# This implies DepositGreaterThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, amount), 1500) will be true if amount >= 2000.\n# Let's represent the deposit as a variable `deposit_og` for Olive Garden.\n# Since DepositRequired(oliveGarden) is true, and RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is true,\n# and DepositGreaterThan(2000, 1500) is true, the deposit for Olive Garden must be >= 2000.\n# Thus, DepositAmount(oliveGarden, deposit_og) implies deposit_og >= 2000.\n# This directly implies LessThan(deposit_og, 1500) is false for Olive Garden.\n\n# Implicitly, if a building is managed, a deposit is required and it's related to the rent.\n# The rule: \u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 DepositRequired(b)) already covers this.\n# The rule: \u2200b (DepositRequired(b) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(b) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(b)))\n# can be more precisely modeled as the deposit amount being either equal to or greater than the rent.\n# Let's refine

relation for managed buildings.\n# The scenario states \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\"\n# This means for any managed building `b`, if a deposit amount `d` exists for it,\n# and the rent amount is `r`, then `d = r` or `d > r`.\n# Let's make this explicit for any managed building.\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 \u2200d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 (d

rule that deposit is >= rent, the deposit must be at least $2000.\n# This means the condition LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 1500), 1500) will be false.\n# If AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) were true, Tom would NOT rent because DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) with d>=2000 means LessThan(d, 1500) is false.\n\n# Let's make the deposit constraint more explicit for Olive Garden without inferring its exact amount,\n# but enough to resolve the \"less than $1500\" condition.\n# From \"The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more\" and \"The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000\",\n# it implies the deposit for Olive Garden is >= $2000.\n# We can add this as an explicit premise or ensure our general rules imply it.\n# The premise MoreThan(2000, 1500) is already given.\n# Let's add a premise that for Olive Garden, the deposit is at least the rent.\n\u2200d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2192 MoreThan(d, 1500))\n\n# Now the rule for Tom renting can be applied:\n# \u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500)))\n# For b = oliveGarden:\n# Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 1500), 1500))\n# Since we have \u2200d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2192 MoreThan(d, 1500)), this means LessThan(DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 1500), 1500) is false.\n# Therefore, Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 False)\n# Which simplifies to Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 False.\n# So Tom will not rent at the Olive Garden. This is consistent with the scenario.\n\n# Let's remove the redundant existential premise if it's not strictly needed for the core logic.\n# \u2203x \u2203y (ManagedBuilding(y) \u2227 AllowedPet(x, y)) - This is generally true, but not used in the specific rules for Tom.\n# It might be there to assert that pets are allowed in *some* managed buildings.\n\n# The predicate `DepositGreaterThan(x, y)` was not defined. Let's assume `MoreThan(x, y)` is its equivalent.\n# The premise `\u2200b (DepositRequired(b) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(b) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(b)))`\n# could be more directly represented using `DepositAmount`.\n# Let's replace the `DepositEqualToOneMonthRent` and `DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent` predicates.\n# For any managed building b, and its deposit amount d, and rent amount r: d = r OR d > r.\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 \u2200d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 (d = RentAmount(b, r) \u2228 MoreThan(d, r))))\n# This implicitly covers the DepositRequired(b) aspect for managed buildings.\n\n# Final check of the rule for Tom renting:\n# \u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500)))\n# The use of `LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500)` is a bit unusual. It seems to be trying to express\n# that the *amount of the deposit* is less than 1500. The `1500` here acts as a specific value.\n# The predicate `DepositAmount(b, y)` means the deposit for building `b` is `y`.\n# So, `LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500)` means \"the deposit amount for building b is 1500, AND 1500 is less than 1500\", which is always false.\n# This seems like a bug. It should likely be checking if the deposit amount *is* less than 1500.\n# A better way to express \"the deposit amount for building b is less than 1500\" would be:\n# \u2203d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))\n\n# Let's correct the rule for Tom renting:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u2203d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))\n\n# Now let's re-evaluate Olive Garden with the corrected rule and the premise:\n# \u2200d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2192 MoreThan(d, 1500))\n# This means for Olive Garden, there is no `d` such that `LessThan(d, 1500)` is true.\n# So `\u2203d (DepositAmount(oliveGarden, d) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))` is false for Olive Garden.\n# Thus, Rent(tom, oliveGarden) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, oliveGarden) \u2227 False), which is False.\n# Tom will not rent at Olive Garden.\n\n# Let's consolidate the premises and clean up.\n\n# New Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",
