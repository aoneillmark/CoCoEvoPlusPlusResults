The task is to simplify/fix.\n\n# The original rule: \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This is fine as a general rule.\n\n# The symptom: SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)\n# This might imply that `feelingTired` itself is an instance of a symptom, not the state.\n# If we treat symptoms as types:\n# SymptomType(Fever)\n# SymptomOf(Fever, Monkeypox)\n# And the rule about glu:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 ExperiencesSymptom(x, FeelingTired))\n# This introduces new predicates. Let's stick to existing ones.\n\n# Simplification:\n# The original program has `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)`.\n# And `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`.\n# This implies that the *state* of feeling tired can be caused by either Monkeypox or Glu.\n# The most direct interpretation of the symptom list is that the state of feeling tired is a symptom.\n# If `FeelingTired(x)` means \"x is feeling tired\", then\n# `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is odd. It should be `SymptomOf(state_of_feeling_tired, monkeypox)`.\n# Let's assume `FeelingTired(x)` means \"x is the state of feeling tired\".\n\n# The original premises are logically sound given the predicates.\n# The potential \"bug\" or \"missing edge-case\" might be how the general rule about glu\n# interacts with the symptom of feeling tired.\n# The current rules are:\n# 1. Monkeypox causes feeling tired (via SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)).\n# 2. Glu causes feeling tired (via \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))).\n\n# There's no explicit logical connection made between Monkeypox and Glu.\n# If the intent was \"Monkeypox causes a person to feel tired, and this tiredness is a form of 'feeling tired'\",\n# then the initial formulation `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is a bit abstract.\n\n# Let's try to make it more concrete:\n# Let `PersonWithMonkeypox(p)` mean person `p` has Monkeypox.\n# Let `ExperiencesTiredness(p)` mean person `p` experiences tiredness.\n\n# Then the symptom list implies:\n# \u2200p (PersonWithMonkeypox(p) \u2192 ExperiencesTiredness(p))\n\n# And the glu rule:\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(p) \u2192 ExperiencesTiredness(p))\n\n# The original predicates are:\n# FeelingTired(x) ::: x is feeling tired. (This seems to represent the state)\n# SymptomOf(x, y) ::: x is a symptom of y.\n\n# So, `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` implies that the *concept* or *type* of symptom is 'feeling tired'.\n# And `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` implies that if a person has a glu, they are in the state of feeling tired.\n\n# The simplest fix is to assume that if someone has monkeypox, they experience the state of feeling tired.\n# This could be stated as:\n# \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2227 Person(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# But this is inferring from the symptom.\n\n# Let's stick to minimal changes. The structure seems okay.\n# The premise `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` is correct for the sentence \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# The symptom `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is also a direct translation.\n# There are no logical bugs *within* these statements given the predicates.\n# The potential \"missing edge-case\" could be about specifying *which* feeling tired is a symptom.\n# However, without more information, the current setup is a reasonable representation.\n\n# One possible simplification is to use more general predicates if the intention is to\n# represent that Monkeypox *causes* the feeling of tiredness in humans.\n# But sticking to the vocabulary, the original is fine.\n\n# Let's assume the original predicates are meant to be used as follows:\n# `FeelingTired(x)`: x is an instance of feeling tired.\n# `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)`: The instance 'feelingTired' is a symptom of monkeypox.\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`: A person experiencing glu is an instance of feeling tired.\n\n# The main issue might be the ambiguity of `FeelingTired(x)`. Is it a state that a person is in, or an abstract concept of \"feeling tired\"?\n# Given `SymptomOf(Fever, monkeypox)`, `Fever` is likely an instance of the symptom.\n# So `FeelingTired` in `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is also an instance.\n# And `FeelingTired(x)` in the rule for glu means `x` is in that state.\n\n# So, `feelingTired` as a symptom instance is distinct from `FeelingTired(x)` as a state.\n# This is a weakness.\n\n# Let's redefine `FeelingTired(x)` to mean \"x is the state of feeling tired\".\n# And the symptom list refers to the *type* of symptom.\n# So, `SymptomType(FeelingTired)` and `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, monkeypox)`.\n# But the task is to *not* add new predicates.\n\n# The simplest fix/simplification is to make the relationship between the symptom list\n# and the general rule about feeling tired more explicit if that's the intention.\n# However, the prompt says \"simplify logic\". The current logic is not overly complex.\n\n# Let's reconsider the original phrasing: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This is a causal statement.\n# And \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\". This implies Monkeypox leads to feeling tired.\n\n# The only potential simplification or fix related to the logic could be if the intention\n# was that the *cause* of feeling tired due to Monkeypox is also a \"glu\" in some sense,\n# or that the *mechanism* is similar. But this is not stated.\n\n# Let's make a slight adjustment to clarify that symptoms are conditions that a person can have.\n# The predicate `FeelingTired(x)` is fine as \"x is feeling tired\".\n# The symptom list `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is still problematic if `feelingTired` is meant as a type.\n# If it's an instance, then we have `FeelingTired(feelingTired_instance)`.\n\n# Let's try to make the symptoms instances of a *condition* that a person can have.\n# Let's use the predicate `HasCondition(x, c)` where `x` is a person and `c` is a condition.\n# But we can't add predicates.\n\n# Therefore, let's assume `FeelingTired(x)` means \"x is a state of feeling tired\".\n# And the symptom list `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` implies that for any person `p`\n# who has monkeypox, they will be in the state `FeelingTired(p)`.\n# This is not directly supported by `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` alone.\n\n# The most logical change to fix an implicit assumption or simplify:\n# The premise `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is intended to mean that experiencing `feelingTired` is characteristic of Monkeypox.\n# And `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` is a rule about what causes `FeelingTired`.\n# The most direct way to express \"feeling tired is a symptom of Monkeypox\" using `FeelingTired(x)`\n# as a state is:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Monkeypox(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This is a strong inference from the symptom list. Let's add this as a clarification.\n\n# Final plan:\n# The original predicates are mostly fine.\n# The primary \"fix\" or \"simplification\" would be to make the implication of \"feeling tired\" as a symptom more explicit, by inferring that if a person has Monkeypox, they feel tired.\n# This bridges the gap between `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` and the general state `FeelingTired(x)`.\n\n# The original program correctly translates the statements.\n# The only area of potential ambiguity is the symptom \"feeling tired\".\n# \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired.\"\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n\n# The original program uses:\n# `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)`\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n\n# The first premise treats `feelingTired` as an instance of a symptom.\n# The second premise treats `FeelingTired(x)` as a state.\n# To resolve this, we can assume that if someone has Monkeypox, they experience the state of feeling tired.\n# This can be expressed as:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Monkeypox(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This is an inference from the symptom list that connects the symptom to the person experiencing it.\n\n# Let's re-examine the other symptoms: Fever, Headache, MusclePains.\n# These are also abstract. `SymptomOf(Fever, monkeypox)`.\n# This implies `Fever(x)` is a symptom.\n# If we were to add the same logic for Fever:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Monkeypox(x) \u2192 Fever(x))\n# This seems to be the intended meaning of listing symptoms.\n\n# So, the \"fix\" is to add this general implication for feeling tired, consistent with how symptoms are generally understood to affect individuals.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (Human(x) \u2227 Glu(x))\n",

The task is to simplify/fix.\n\n# The original rule: \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This is fine as a general rule.\n\n# The symptom: SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)\n# This might imply that `feelingTired` itself is an instance of a symptom, not the state.\n# If we treat symptoms as types:\n# SymptomType(Fever)\n# SymptomOf(Fever, Monkeypox)\n# And the rule about glu:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 ExperiencesSymptom(x, FeelingTired))\n# This introduces new predicates. Let's stick to existing ones.\n\n# Simplification:\n# The original program has `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)`.\n# And `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`.\n# This implies that the *state* of feeling tired can be caused by either Monkeypox or Glu.\n# The most direct interpretation of the symptom list is that the state of feeling tired is a symptom.\n# If `FeelingTired(x)` means \"x is feeling tired\", then\n# `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is odd. It should be `SymptomOf(state_of_feeling_tired, monkeypox)`.\n# Let's assume `FeelingTired(x)` means \"x is the state of feeling tired\".\n\n# The original premises are logically sound given the predicates.\n# The potential \"bug\" or \"missing edge-case\" might be how the general rule about glu\n# interacts with the symptom of feeling tired.\n# The current rules are:\n# 1. Monkeypox causes feeling tired (via SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)).\n# 2. Glu causes feeling tired (via \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))).\n\n# There's no explicit logical connection made between Monkeypox and Glu.\n# If the intent was \"Monkeypox causes a person to feel tired, and this tiredness is a form of 'feeling tired'\",\n# then the initial formulation `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is a bit abstract.\n\n# Let's try to make it more concrete:\n# Let `PersonWithMonkeypox(p)` mean person `p` has Monkeypox.\n# Let `ExperiencesTiredness(p)` mean person `p` experiences tiredness.\n\n# Then the symptom list implies:\n# \u2200p (PersonWithMonkeypox(p) \u2192 ExperiencesTiredness(p))\n\n# And the glu rule:\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(p) \u2192 ExperiencesTiredness(p))\n\n# The original predicates are:\n# FeelingTired(x) ::: x is feeling tired. (This seems to represent the state)\n# SymptomOf(x, y) ::: x is a symptom of y.\n\n# So, `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` implies that the *concept* or *type* of symptom is 'feeling tired'.\n# And `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` implies that if a person has a glu, they are in the state of feeling tired.\n\n# The simplest fix is to assume that if someone has monkeypox, they experience the state of feeling tired.\n# This could be stated as:\n# \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2227 Person(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# But this is inferring from the symptom.\n\n# Let's stick to minimal changes. The structure seems okay.\n# The premise `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` is correct for the sentence \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# The symptom `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is also a direct translation.\n# There are no logical bugs *within* these statements given the predicates.\n# The potential \"missing edge-case\" could be about specifying *which* feeling tired is a symptom.\n# However, without more information, the current setup is a reasonable representation.\n\n# One possible simplification is to use more general predicates if the intention is to\n# represent that Monkeypox *causes* the feeling of tiredness in humans.\n# But sticking to the vocabulary, the original is fine.\n\n# Let's assume the original predicates are meant to be used as follows:\n# `FeelingTired(x)`: x is an instance of feeling tired.\n# `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)`: The instance 'feelingTired' is a symptom of monkeypox.\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`: A person experiencing glu is an instance of feeling tired.\n\n# The main issue might be the ambiguity of `FeelingTired(x)`. Is it a state that a person is in, or an abstract concept of \"feeling tired\"?\n# Given `SymptomOf(Fever, monkeypox)`, `Fever` is likely an instance of the symptom.\n# So `FeelingTired` in `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is also an instance.\n# And `FeelingTired(x)` in the rule for glu means `x` is in that state.\n\n# So, `feelingTired` as a symptom instance is distinct from `FeelingTired(x)` as a state.\n# This is a weakness.\n\n# Let's redefine `FeelingTired(x)` to mean \"x is the state of feeling tired\".\n# And the symptom list refers to the *type* of symptom.\n# So, `SymptomType(FeelingTired)` and `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, monkeypox)`.\n# But the task is to *not* add new predicates.\n\n# The simplest fix/simplification is to make the relationship between the symptom list\n# and the general rule about feeling tired more explicit if that's the intention.\n# However, the prompt says \"simplify logic\". The current logic is not overly complex.\n\n# Let's reconsider the original phrasing: \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This is a causal statement.\n# And \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired\". This implies Monkeypox leads to feeling tired.\n\n# The only potential simplification or fix related to the logic could be if the intention\n# was that the *cause* of feeling tired due to Monkeypox is also a \"glu\" in some sense,\n# or that the *mechanism* is similar. But this is not stated.\n\n# Let's make a slight adjustment to clarify that symptoms are conditions that a person can have.\n# The predicate `FeelingTired(x)` is fine as \"x is feeling tired\".\n# The symptom list `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is still problematic if `feelingTired` is meant as a type.\n# If it's an instance, then we have `FeelingTired(feelingTired_instance)`.\n\n# Let's try to make the symptoms instances of a *condition* that a person can have.\n# Let's use the predicate `HasCondition(x, c)` where `x` is a person and `c` is a condition.\n# But we can't add predicates.\n\n# Therefore, let's assume `FeelingTired(x)` means \"x is a state of feeling tired\".\n# And the symptom list `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` implies that for any person `p`\n# who has monkeypox, they will be in the state `FeelingTired(p)`.\n# This is not directly supported by `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` alone.\n\n# The most logical change to fix an implicit assumption or simplify:\n# The premise `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` is intended to mean that experiencing `feelingTired` is characteristic of Monkeypox.\n# And `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))` is a rule about what causes `FeelingTired`.\n# The most direct way to express \"feeling tired is a symptom of Monkeypox\" using `FeelingTired(x)`\n# as a state is:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Monkeypox(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This is a strong inference from the symptom list. Let's add this as a clarification.\n\n# Final plan:\n# The original predicates are mostly fine.\n# The primary \"fix\" or \"simplification\" would be to make the implication of \"feeling tired\" as a symptom more explicit, by inferring that if a person has Monkeypox, they feel tired.\n# This bridges the gap between `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)` and the general state `FeelingTired(x)`.\n\n# The original program correctly translates the statements.\n# The only area of potential ambiguity is the symptom \"feeling tired\".\n# \"Symptons of Monkeypox include ... feeling tired.\"\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n\n# The original program uses:\n# `SymptomOf(feelingTired, monkeypox)`\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n\n# The first premise treats `feelingTired` as an instance of a symptom.\n# The second premise treats `FeelingTired(x)` as a state.\n# To resolve this, we can assume that if someone has Monkeypox, they experience the state of feeling tired.\n# This can be expressed as:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Monkeypox(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))\n# This is an inference from the symptom list that connects the symptom to the person experiencing it.\n\n# Let's re-examine the other symptoms: Fever, Headache, MusclePains.\n# These are also abstract. `SymptomOf(Fever, monkeypox)`.\n# This implies `Fever(x)` is a symptom.\n# If we were to add the same logic for Fever:\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Monkeypox(x) \u2192 Fever(x))\n# This seems to be the intended meaning of listing symptoms.\n\n# So, the \"fix\" is to add this general implication for feeling tired, consistent with how symptoms are generally understood to affect individuals.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acSymptomOf(Coughing, mp)\n",
