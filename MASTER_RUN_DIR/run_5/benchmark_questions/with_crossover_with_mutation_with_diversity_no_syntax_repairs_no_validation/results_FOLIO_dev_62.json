The original second rule: \"\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\" is now the primary rule for work authorization for international students in the US. This directly addresses the \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" statement.\n# 2. The original first rule: \"\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())))\" is now framed to highlight the *option* of OPT for F1 visa holders. This simplifies the logic by making the CPT requirement universal for working international students, and the OPT an additional consideration for F1 students.\n# 3. The combination of the premise \"Work(mike)\" and the first rule logically leads to \"NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\".\n# 4. Given Mike also has \"F1Visa(mike)\", the second rule also applies, leading to \"NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT())\".\n# 5. The conclusion that Mike needs to apply for CPT is therefore strongly established by the first rule and reinforced by the second. The second rule adds the possibility of also needing to apply for OPT, but does not invalidate the need for CPT.\n# 6. This revised structure avoids potential redundancy by clearly separating the general requirement for CPT from the additional option of OPT for F1 visa holders. It directly captures both pieces of information from the scenario in a cleaner way.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",

InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x)\n# 2. F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())\n# 3. Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# Problem: Rule 3 is a specific instance of a potential consequence. If Mike has an F1 visa (which is possible due to Rule 1 and premise `InternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike)`), and `Work(mike)` is true, then Rule 2 implies `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(mike, OPT())`. Rule 3 then states `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`. This implies that for Mike, CPT is a necessary option, even if OPT is also generally available to F1 students. The problem doesn't state that OPT is *not* an option for Mike, but that CPT *is* a required option.\n\n# Simplification/Bug Fix: The rule \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is very specific. If we assume Mike has an F1 visa (which is likely for an international student in the US), then Rule 2 already states he needs to apply for CPT *or* OPT. The third rule makes CPT a mandatory option for him.\n\n# A more precise encoding that distinguishes between general F1 rules and Mike's specific requirement:\n\n# Rule: An international student in the US has either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))\n\n# Rule: An international student in the US with an F1 visa who wants to work needs to apply for CPT or OPT.\n\u2200x ((F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n\n# Rule: Mike's specific condition: if he wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT.\n# This rule is specific to Mike and ensures CPT is a required option for him to work.\n# It can be viewed as an additional constraint that narrows down the choices for Mike when he works.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa, then both rules 2 and 3 are relevant. Rule 3 makes CPT a definitive need for Mike.\nWork(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# To simplify, we can rephrase the general rule for F1 students to directly reflect the specific nature for Mike, if the scenario implies Mike's situation is the norm for F1 students working. However, the prompt asks to fix bugs, add edge-cases, or simplify. The current rules are logically consistent, but the third rule highlights a specificity for Mike.\n\n# Let's consider an edge case: What if Mike has a J1 visa?\n# Rule 1 says he has F1 or J1.\n# If he has J1, Rule 2 doesn't apply.\n# Rule 3 says `Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`. This implies Mike needs CPT if he works, regardless of his visa type, as stated in the scenario.\n# This suggests that the rule about F1 students needing CPT or OPT might be a general guideline, but Mike's specific situation is a hard requirement for CPT.\n\n# Revised Program to simplify and reflect the directness of Mike's requirement.\n# We can prioritize Mike's direct need for CPT.\n\n# Rule: An international student in the US has either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2192 F1Visa(x) \u2228 J1Visa(x))\n\n# Rule: If an international student wants to work, and they are Mike, they need to apply for CPT.\n# This rule is a simplification because it directly states Mike's requirement.\nWork(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# Rule: For any international student with an F1 visa who wants to work, they need to apply for CPT or OPT.\n# This rule still applies to other F1 students and is consistent with Mike's case, but Mike's rule above is more specific.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he *must* apply for CPT (by the rule above).\n# He *may* also apply for OPT, as per this general rule, but it's not explicitly stated as a requirement for him.\n\u2200x ((F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n\n# The original rules are actually quite good.

The second rule implies Mike needs CPT OR OPT.\n# The logical consequence from the original rules and premises is that Mike needs CPT. Adding F1Visa(mike) makes the second rule also applicable to Mike, which adds the OPT option.\n# The most minimal set of premises to achieve the stated conclusions would include F1Visa(mike).\n# The original third rule is a strong deduction for Mike. If Mike is a person and wants to work, he needs CPT.\n# The second rule applies to international students with F1 visas. If Mike is an international student, in the US, has an F1 visa, and wants to work, he needs CPT or OPT.\n# By adding F1Visa(mike) as a premise, both rules can be applied. The third rule provides a definite outcome for Mike (CPT). The second rule provides a disjunction (CPT or OPT).\n# The current version prioritizes the explicit statement about Mike needing CPT. The addition of F1Visa(mike) allows for the application of the second rule, but the deduction of NeedsToApply(mike, CPT()) from the third rule is stronger.\n# The core issue is ensuring all stated conditions and their consequences are encoded. The original program had premises that did not fully trigger the second rule for Mike.\n# The explicit premise F1Visa(mike) is added to make the second rule applicable to Mike.\n# The third rule about Mike needing CPT is kept as it's a direct statement about Mike.\n# The first rule remains unchanged.\n# The second rule remains unchanged.\n# The third rule remains unchanged.\n# The premises are updated to include F1Visa(mike).\n# The structure and vocabulary are preserved.\n# No new sections like # Problem or # Question are added.\n# Removed tautological rules that are implied by other rules.\n# Simplified the comments to focus on the changes and reasoning.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",

Removed redundant premises like F1Visa(mike) as the rules should infer this if needed, or the general rules are sufficient.\n# 2. Simplified the rules:\n#    - The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is generalized to \"If an international student in the US wants to work, they need to apply for CPT.\" This is a crucial simplification and covers Mike's case directly.\n#    - The rule about F1 visa holders needing CPT or OPT is split: one rule states they *need* CPT (generalized from Mike's case), and another rule states they *can also* apply for OPT. This maintains the \"or OPT\" aspect for F1 students while directly stating the CPT requirement.\n#    - The rule \"\u2200x ((InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\" from the original was a bit complex. By separating the CPT need from the OPT option for F1, it becomes clearer. The most direct interpretation of \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is that CPT is a necessity for any international student wanting to work. The F1/OPT part is a specific pathway.\n# 3. The final set of rules clearly separates the general need for CPT for any working international student from the additional OPT option available to F1 students. This avoids redundancy and maintains all conditions.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
