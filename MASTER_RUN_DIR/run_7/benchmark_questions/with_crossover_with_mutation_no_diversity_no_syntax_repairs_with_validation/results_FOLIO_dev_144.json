If breeding back is a *form* of artificial selection, and artificial selection is *defined* as selective breeding,\n# then breeding back inherently *is* selective breeding.\n# Let's assume the intention is that BreedingBack implies ArtificialSelection, and ArtificialSelection implies SelectiveBreeding.\n# The existing two premises capture this chain: BreedingBack -> ArtificialSelection -> SelectiveBreeding. This is likely correct.\n# The phrasing \"by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals\" describes what artificial selection *is*.\n\n# Premise 3: Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s.\n# BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s) - This is a fact about a specific entity (Heck cattle group) and time. Fine.\n\n# Premise 4: Heck cattle were bred-back to resemble the aurochs.\n# \u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Resemble(x, aurochs)) - This establishes the resemblance. Fine.\n\n# Premise 5: Heck cattle are animals.\n# \u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Animal(x)) - This establishes their type. Fine.\n\n# Premise 6: Aurochs are animals.\n# \u2200x (Aurochs(x) \u2192 Animal(x)) - This establishes their type. Fine.\n\n# Premise 7: Some animals to be bred-back resemble animals that are extinct.\n# \u2203x (ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 Animal(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))\n# This premise is crucial. It states existence.\n# - `ToBreedBack(x)`: x is an animal intended to be bred back.\n# - `Animal(x)`: x is an animal.\n# - `\u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y))`: there exists some animal y which is extinct, and x resembles y.\n# This premise is well-formed and covers the described scenario.\n\n# Potential simplifications or edge cases:\n# 1. The constants `heckCattle` and `aurochs` are used without explicit definition as constants.\n#    It's common to assume that if a symbol is used like this, it refers to a specific entity.\n#    We can make this explicit if desired, but it's often implicitly understood in FOL.\n#    Let's assume `heckCattle` refers to the group of Heck Cattle and `aurochs` refers to the species of Aurochs.\n\n# 2. The relationship between `BreedingBack(x)` and `BredBack(x, y)`.\n#    `BreedingBack(x)` could mean \"x is a process of breeding back\".\n#    `BredBack(x, y)` could mean \"x was bred back in year y\".\n#    The premise `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` implies that the *group* Heck Cattle was a subject of a breeding back action.\n#    This is slightly different from `BreedingBack(heckCattle)`.\n#    The original prompt uses `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)`. If we are to *fix bugs*, we need to consider if this is the intended interpretation.\n#    The sentence \"Heck cattle were bred-back in the 1920s.\" directly supports `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)`.\n#    The sentence \"Breeding back is a form of artificial selection.\" uses the predicate `BreedingBack(x)`.\n#    It's possible that `BreedingBack(x)` refers to a process, and `BredBack(x, y)` refers to an event of an entity being acted upon.\n#    Let's assume the current predicates and premises are meant to be used as is, without merging these concepts unless explicitly stated.\n\n# 3. The predicate `ToBreedBack(x)` is used in one premise.\n#    It represents \"x is an animal to be bred back\".\n#    This is distinct from `HeckCattle(x)` or `Aurochs(x)`.\n#    The premise \u2203x (ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 Animal(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))\n#    is a general statement about some animals. Heck cattle are a specific example of animals that *were* bred back,\n#    and they resemble aurochs (which are extinct).\n#    It is possible that `ToBreedBack(x)` is a more general category that Heck cattle could belong to, if they were being bred *now* for a specific purpose.\n#    However, the scenario states \"Heck cattle were bred-back...\", implying a past event.\n#    The premise about `ToBreedBack` speaks about \"animals to be bred back\" in a more general, potentially ongoing, or future sense.\n#    Let's stick to the explicit definitions.\n\n# Re-evaluation of the original premises for potential bugs or omissions:\n# The premises seem to directly translate the sentences.\n# The primary \"bug\" might be in the implicit assumptions or the exact interpretation of predicate names.\n# The current premises do not create contradictions or illogical statements.\n# The task is to improve the encoding by fixing bugs, adding missing edge-cases, or simplifying logic.\n\n# Let's consider the implicit relationship between `HeckCattle` and `Aurochs` being extinct.\n# The scenario states \"Some animals to be bred-back resemble animals that are extinct.\"\n# It also states \"Heck cattle were bred-back ... to resemble the aurochs.\"\n# This implies that aurochs are extinct. However, there is no explicit premise stating `Extinct(aurochs)`.\n# This is a missing piece of information that can be inferred from the connection.\n\n# Added premise: Aurochs are extinct.\n# This is implicitly understood from \"Heck cattle were bred-back ... to resemble the aurochs\" and \"Some animals to be bred-back resemble animals that are extinct.\"\n# If aurochs were not extinct, the resemblance of Heck cattle to them wouldn't fit the general statement about breeding back to extinct animals.\n\n# Let's refine the premise about `ToBreedBack` to be more explicit about the resemblance being to extinct animals, as per the general statement.\n# The current premise already does this: \u2203x (ToBreedBack(x) \u2227 Animal(x) \u2227 \u2203y (Animal(y) \u2227 Extinct(y) \u2227 Resemble(x, y)))\n\n# Let's add the missing explicit premise that Aurochs are extinct.\n# It's a direct inference from the overall context.\n\n# Consider the use of `heckCattle` and `aurochs` as specific instances vs. general types.\n# `HeckCattle(x)` is a predicate, suggesting 'x is Heck cattle'.\n# `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` uses `heckCattle` as a constant.\n# `Resemble(x, aurochs)` uses `aurochs` as a constant.\n# This implies `heckCattle` and `aurochs` are constants referring to the collective group of Heck cattle and the species of Aurochs, respectively.\n# The premise `\u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 ...)` means for any individual `x` that is a Heck cattle.\n# This suggests a potential mismatch: are `heckCattle` and `aurochs` constants or are they meant to be universally quantified?\n# If `heckCattle` is a constant, then `BredBack(heckCattle, year1920s)` is a statement about that constant.\n# And `\u2200x (HeckCattle(x) \u2192 Resemble(x, aurochs))` means *every individual* Heck cattle resembles the *species* Aurochs. This is a reasonable interpretation.\n\n# Revised program incorporating the inferred extinction of Aurochs.\n\n# Conclusion:\nAurochs(x)\n",
