The statement `\u2203p (Parent(p, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203p2 (Parent(p2, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 p \u2260 p2))` correctly asserts that there is exactly one parent.

The existing premise `\u2203p (Parent(p, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203p2 (Parent(p2, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 p \u2260 p2))` correctly specifies that a single-parent family has exactly one parent.\nTherefore, no change is needed for the single-parent family logic.\nThe definition of `MoreThanOneYear` is fine.\nThe definitions for `GRE`, `FinancialAid`, `Applicant`, `GREApplicant`, `Prove`, `Tom`, `Person`, `LivesIn`, `Dad`, `OutOfWork` are also standard and do not require changes.\nThe core logic relating `GREApplicant`, `Prove`, `EconomicHardship`, and `Provides(ETS, FinancialAid, x)` is also correctly encoded.\nThe definitions of `Cost`, `Difficulty`, `CausedBy`, `HavingTooLittleMoney`, `HavingTooFewResources` are clear.\nThe main bug to fix is the underspecification of the single-parent family. The statement `\u2203p (Parent(p, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203p2 (Parent(p2, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 p \u2260 p2))` correctly asserts that there is exactly one parent. However, it does not explicitly define the `Parent` predicate. We should add `Parent` as a predicate and assume its existence in the context of families.\n\nRevised Premises:\nCost(gre, 205USD).\n\u2200x (GREApplicant(x) \u2227 Prove(x, EconomicHardship) \u2192 Provides(ets, FinancialAid, x)).\nEconomicHardship(x) \u2194 (Difficulty(x) \u2227 (CausedBy(x, HavingTooLittleMoney) \u2228 CausedBy(x, HavingTooFewResources))).\nTom(tom).\nPerson(tom).\nLivesIn(tom, SingleParentFamily).\n# Explicitly stating that 'SingleParentFamily' implies there is exactly one parent.\n\u2203p (Parent(p, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 \u00ac\u2203p2 (Parent(p2, SingleParentFamily) \u2227 p \u2260 p2)).\nDad(d, tom).\nOutOfWork(d, MoreThanOneYear).\nMoreThanOneYear(y) \u2192 Year(y) \u2227 y > 1.\nGRE(gre).\nFinancialAid(fa).\nApplicant(tom).\nGREApplicant(tom).\nProve(tom, EconomicHardship).\n# Adding the Parent predicate definition which was missing and implicitly used.\nParent(x, y) ::: x is a parent of y.\n# Adding ETS and USD predicates as they are used.\nETS(ets) ::: ETS is an entity.\nUSD(usd) ::: usd is a unit of currency.\n# Adding MoreThanOneYear predicate definition which was used.\nMoreThanOneYear(y) ::: y represents a duration of more than one year.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (Applicant(x) \u2227 GRE(x) \u2227 Provides(ETS, FinancialAid, x))\n",
