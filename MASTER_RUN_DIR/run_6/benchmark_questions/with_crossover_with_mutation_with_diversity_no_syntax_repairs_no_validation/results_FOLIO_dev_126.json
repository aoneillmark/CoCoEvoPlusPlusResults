If we are to infer anything about Rock, we must assume the premise.\n# The simplest way to interpret the \"If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird, then Rock neither flies nor breathes\" is that Rock does not fly and does not breathe, under the stated conditions.\n# If we want to simplify logic, we can directly state the implications for Rock that follow from the rules if we assume Rock *is* not a bird and *does not* fly.\n# However, without asserting Rock is not a bird, or Rock does not fly, the original rules are conditionals.\n# The most direct way to simplify is to assume the 'if' part for Rock holds if we are to derive anything.\n# If we are given \"Rock is neither a fly nor a bird\" as an implicit premise about Rock, then we can state Rock does not fly and Rock does not breathe.\n# But the original program keeps them as conditionals for Rock.\n# Let's assume the intent is to represent the specific deductions for Rock if it meets certain criteria.\n# The most significant simplification would be to remove the tautological rule.\n# And for the second rule, (\u00acFlies(rock) \u2227 \u00acBird(rock)) \u2192 \u00acBreathes(rock), it correctly states a consequence for Rock.\n\n# Revised rule for Rock, removing the tautology and keeping the valid implication.\n# The premise \"If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird\" is a bit ambiguous.

Rock *is* a thing that is neither a fly nor a bird.\n\n# Given the prompt is about fixing bugs and simplifying, the tautology is a bug.\n# The second rule for Rock implies that if Rock is not a bird and does not fly, it does not breathe.\n# This implies Rock is not an Animal if these conditions are met, because Animals breathe.\n# However, let's just represent the provided rules as concisely as possible.\n# The structure of the original rules is to state a condition and then a consequence for Rock.\n# We remove the redundant rule.\n\n# If Rock is not a bird and does not fly, then Rock does not breathe.\n\u2200x ((\u00acFlies(x) \u2227 \u00acBird(x)) \u2192 \u00acBreathes(x)) [rock]\n\n# Let's use a constant `rock` directly instead of a variable `x` for the last rule.\n(\u00acFlies(rock) \u2227 \u00acBird(rock)) \u2192 \u00acBreathes(rock)\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00acHasWings(rock)\n",
