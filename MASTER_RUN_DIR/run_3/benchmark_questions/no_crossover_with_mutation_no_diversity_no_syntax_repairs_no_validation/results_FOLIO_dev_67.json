by a more complex relation, but for this simplification, we assume\n# the enumeration covers all constituent parts that are being counted.\n# For the purpose of this simplified model, we infer that the named constituent parts\n# are the ones making up the count of 27.\n\n# Simplification: The predicate Organized(x, y) in the original program is split into\n# OrganizedInto(x, y) and HasConstituentCount(y, count).\n# The predicate College(x) in the original program is now represented by\n# ResidentialCollege, GraduateSchool, and ProfessionalSchool predicates, and they are all\n# subtypes of ConstituentPart.\n# The Year(x) predicate in the original program was a bit ambiguous; it's clarified as YearFounded(x, y).\n\n# Missing Edge Case: The problem statement mentions \"27 constituent colleges and schools\".\n# The original program enumerated 12 professional schools and 14 residential colleges,\n# totaling 26. The Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also listed.\n# Let's assume the list of residential colleges and the specific schools are exhaustive\n# of the 27. This implies there might be a missing constituent part in the explicit listing,\n# or one of the named entities implicitly covers multiple.\n# For this revised model, we will explicitly add the \"yaleConstituentParts\" object and\n# its count to satisfy the \"OrganizedInto\" predicate.\n# We will also ensure that all the listed constituent parts are correctly typed.\n\n# The explicit enumeration of constituent parts implies they are indeed constituent parts of Yale.\n# This is handled by the Part_Of predicate.\n# The type of constituent parts (ResidentialCollege, GraduateSchool, ProfessionalSchool)\n# are also correctly assigned.\n# The names are correctly mapped.\n\n# A potential simplification: instead of explicitly listing all constituent parts,\n# one could define them implicitly through properties. However, given the explicit list\n# in the context, maintaining this explicitness is appropriate.\n\n# The relationship between a university and its constituent parts is made explicit with the Part_Of predicate.\n# The original program used a more implicit structure where the entities were just declared as ConstituentPart.\n\n# The `yaleConstituentParts` object is introduced to represent the collection of all constituent parts for the `OrganizedInto` predicate.\n# The `HasConstituentCount` predicate is used to associate the count with this collection.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (University(x) \u2227 EndowmentValue(x, y) \u2227 y > 42300000000)\n",

by a more complex relation, but for this simplification, we assume\n# the enumeration covers all constituent parts that are being counted.\n# For the purpose of this simplified model, we infer that the named constituent parts\n# are the ones making up the count of 27.\n\n# Simplification: The predicate Organized(x, y) in the original program is split into\n# OrganizedInto(x, y) and

constituent colleges and schools\".\n# The original program enumerated 12 professional schools and 14 residential colleges,\n# totaling 26. The Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also listed.\n# Let's assume the list of residential colleges and the specific schools are exhaustive\n# of the 27. This implies there might be a missing constituent part in the explicit listing,\n# or one of the named entities implicitly covers multiple.\n# For this revised model, we will explicitly add the \"yaleConstituentParts\" object and\n# its count to satisfy the \"OrganizedInto\" predicate.\n# We will also ensure that all the listed constituent parts are correctly typed.\n\n# The explicit enumeration of constituent parts implies they are indeed constituent parts of Yale.\n# This is handled by the Part_Of predicate.\n# The type of constituent parts (ResidentialCollege, GraduateSchool, ProfessionalSchool)\n# are also correctly assigned.\n# The names are correctly mapped.\n\n# A potential simplification: instead of explicitly listing all constituent parts,\n# one could define them implicitly through properties. However, given the explicit list\n# in the context, maintaining this explicitness is appropriate.\n\n# The relationship between a university and its constituent parts is made explicit with the Part_Of predicate.\n# The original program used a more implicit structure where the entities were just declared as ConstituentPart.\n\n# The `yaleConstituentParts` object is introduced to represent the collection of all constituent parts for the `OrganizedInto` predicate.\n# The `HasConstituentCount` predicate is used to associate the count with this collection.\n\n# Conclusion:\nConstituent(piersonCollege, yale) \u2227 PartOf(piersonCollege, residentialColleges)\n",
