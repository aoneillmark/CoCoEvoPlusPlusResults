The premise \"\u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))\" was incorrect.\n#    - `SameAirport(y, y)` is always true for any airport `y`. This premise would mean that no one can fly to any airport, which is a contradiction.\n#    - The intent was likely that the departure airport and arrival airport cannot be the same for a single flight. This is now captured by the third premise.\n# 2. Introduced specific premises for the departure and arrival nature of LGA for John and Susan, respectively. This makes the logic more explicit.\n#    - `\u2200person airport_arrival (FliesTo(person, airport_arrival) \u2192 \u00acDeparture(airport_arrival))` ensures that an airport one flies *to* is not a departure airport.\n#    - `\u2200person airport_departure (FliesFrom(person, airport_departure) \u2192 \u00acArrival(airport_departure))` ensures that an airport one flies *from* is not an arrival airport.\n# 3. The premise \"\u2200person airport_departure airport_arrival ( (FliesFrom(person, airport_departure) \u2227 FliesTo(person, airport_arrival)) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(airport_departure, airport_arrival))\" directly addresses the constraint that departure and arrival airports for the *same person's journey* cannot be the same. This is a more precise formulation of the original intent.\n# 4. Added comments to clarify the intent of the helper predicates, assuming LGA has these properties given the scenario.\n\n# Conclusion:\nFliesTo(john, lga)\n",

The most common interpretation is that for any *single flight instance*, the origin != destination.\n\n# Let's assume a predicate `DifferentAirports(x, y)` is implicitly defined as `\u00acSameAirport(x, y)`\n# and `SameAirport(x, y)` means `x` is literally the same airport as `y`.\n# Then the original faulty lines `\u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))` are trying to say\n# that the arrival airport `y` cannot be the same as itself, which is always false if `SameAirport(y, y)` is true.\n# The problem is that `SameAirport(y, y)` is likely always true for any airport `y`.\n# So `\u00acSameAirport(y, y)` is always false.\n# The constraint \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport.\" means:\n# For any flight from airport A to airport B, A must be different from B.\n# If we use `FliesFrom(p, a)` and `FliesTo(p, b)` for the same person `p`, then `a` and `b` must be different.\n# We don't have a direct way to link `FliesFrom` and `FliesTo` for the same person.\n\n# Let's rephrase the constraint: If an airport `X` is the departure for a flight and an airport `Y` is the arrival for that same flight, then `X` and `Y` must be different.\n# A simpler fix, assuming `SameAirport(x, y)` is a proper equivalence relation:\n# The problem states \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport.\"\n# This means for any flight, origin_airport != destination_airport.\n# We can represent this by stating that there is no airport `X` such that a flight departs from `X` and arrives at `X`.\n# `\u00ac\u2203x (Departure(x) \u2227 Arrival(x))` would be too strong.\n# The most accurate representation given the lack of a `SameAirport` predicate that's properly defined:\n# For any flight from X to Y, X and Y are distinct.\n# This can be stated as: there is no airport X such that there is a flight from X to X.\n# This is still an issue.\n\n# Let's consider the original intent of `\u00acSameAirport(y, y)`. If `SameAirport(y, y)` is *meant* to be always true for any airport, then `\u00acSameAirport(y, y)` is always false.\n# This implies the premise `FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y)` would mean `FliesTo(x, y)` must be false if `y` is an airport. This is clearly not intended.\n# The constraint \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" implies that for any flight, the departure airport is distinct from the arrival airport.\n# A simpler way to state this without relying on a `SameAirport` predicate (which was poorly used):\n# If someone flies from airport X to airport Y, then X and Y are different.\n# Without a predicate for \"different\", and given the existing faulty `SameAirport` usage,\n# let's remove the faulty premises and add a rule that directly addresses the constraint.\n\n# New approach:\n# We know Susan flies to LGA. LGA is an arrival airport.\n# We know John flies from LGA. LGA is a departure airport.\n# The constraint is: departure and arrival cannot be the same airport.\n# This means for any flight, the origin airport != destination airport.\n# We can add a rule:\n# \u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 Arrival(y))  -- This is already implicitly handled by the meaning of FliesTo.\n# \u2200x \u2200y (FliesFrom(x, y) \u2192 Departure(y)) -- This is already implicitly handled by the meaning of FliesFrom.\n# The key constraint:\n# No airport can be both a departure and an arrival for the *same* flight.\n# This requires linking departure and arrival for a single flight.\n# Let's assume `SameAirport(a, b)` means `a` is the same airport as `b`.\n# And the constraint is: \u2200p \u2200a \u2200b (FliesFrom(p, a) \u2227 FliesTo(p, b) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(a, b))\n# Since we don't have this structure, let's simplify.\n# The problem states \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport.\"\n# This implies for any flight, origin != destination.\n# Let's assume a hypothetical predicate `DifferentAirports(x, y)` which is true if x is different from y.\n# Then the rule would be: \u2200x \u2200y (FliesFrom(susan, x) \u2227 FliesTo(susan, y) \u2192 DifferentAirports(x, y)).\n# Without `DifferentAirports` or a correctly defined `SameAirport`:\n# The most common interpretation is that `lga` cannot be both the departure and arrival for the same flight.\n# Given the premises:\n# FliesTo(susan, lga)\n# FliesFrom(john, lga)\n# The constraint implies that `lga` cannot be both a departure and an arrival in a way that violates the rule.\n# If Susan flies to LGA, and John flies from LGA, and departure != arrival, this doesn't create a direct contradiction.\n\n# Let's remove the faulty SameAirport premises.\n# Add a more direct statement of the constraint:\n# For any flight from airport X to airport Y, X must be different from Y.\n# We don't have a `Different` predicate.\n# The original predicates are: FliesTo, Airport, Departure, Arrival, SameAirport, FliesFrom.\n# The faulty lines were:\n# \u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))\n# \u2200x \u2200y (FliesFrom(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))\n# These are broken because `\u00acSameAirport(y, y)` is likely always false.\n\n# A simpler fix for the logic:\n# The core constraint is that for any flight, the departure airport is different from the arrival airport.\n# We can express this by stating that there is no airport X such that a flight departs from X and arrives at X.\n# This is too strong.\n# A better way: for any person P, if P flies from A to B, then A != B.\n# Let's assume `SameAirport(x, y)` is correctly defined.\n# Then the constraint is: \u2200p \u2200a \u2200b (FliesFrom(p, a) \u2227 FliesTo(p, b) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(a, b))\n# This requires relating `FliesFrom` and `FliesTo` for the same person.\n\n# Let's simplify the program by removing the problematic `SameAirport` predicate and its usage, and directly encode the constraint in a way that is likely intended.\n# The constraint \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport\" means that for any flight, the origin and destination are distinct.\n# Let's rephrase the problem and the rules.\n\n# CURRENT PROGRAM ANALYSIS:\n# - `FliesTo(susan, lga)`: Susan flies to LGA.\n# - `FliesFrom(john, lga)`: John flies from LGA.\n# - `\u2200x \u2200y (FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))`: This rule is faulty. If `SameAirport(y, y)` is true for all airports `y`, then `\u00acSameAirport(y, y)` is false, making the implication `FliesTo(x, y) \u2192 False`. This would mean no one can fly to any airport.\n# - `\u2200x \u2200y (FliesFrom(x, y) \u2192 \u00acSameAirport(y, y))`: Similar faulty logic for departures.\n\n# FIXES/IMPROVEMENTS:\n# 1. Remove the faulty `SameAirport` premises. They are nonsensical.\n# 2. Explicitly state that LGA is an airport.\n# 3. Add the core constraint: For any flight, the departure airport is different from the arrival airport.\n#    Since we don't have a direct way to link departure and arrival for the *same* flight in this structure,\n#    a common interpretation in similar problems is that no airport can be *both* a departure and an arrival *for the same flight instance*.\n#    Without explicit flight instances or a way to link a person's departure and arrival,\n#    the simplest way to address the *spirit* of the constraint with the given predicates is to state that\n#    if an airport is a departure point, it cannot be the same airport as an arrival point *for a flight*.\n#    Let's enforce that for any given airport X, it cannot be a departure airport and an arrival airport simultaneously. This is still too strong.\n\n# The most direct and common-sense interpretation of \"The departure and arrival can not be the same airport.\" is that for any flight *from* A *to* B, A != B.\n# Since we don't have a `DifferentAirports` predicate or a way to link a specific departure and arrival for a person,\n# we can state that no airport can be *both* a departure airport and an arrival airport *for the same flight context*.\n\n# Revised Program:\n# Remove `SameAirport` predicate as it was used incorrectly.\n# Add premises that directly capture the scenario and the constraint.\n\n# Conclusion:\nFliesTo(john, lga)\n",
