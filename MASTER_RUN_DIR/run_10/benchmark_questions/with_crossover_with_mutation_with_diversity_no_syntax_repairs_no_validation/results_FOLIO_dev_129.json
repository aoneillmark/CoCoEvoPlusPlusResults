Assumed it meant person x has wedding y.\n# The clause `\u2200x \u2200y ((HasWedding(x, y) \u2227 WellAttended(y)) \u2192 (OccursInJuly(y) \u2228 \u00acTravelsToParis(x)))`\n# implies that `HasWedding` can take two arguments. This is inconsistent with `HasWedding(x)` taking one.\n# If `HasWedding(x)` is for a person, then `HasWedding(x, y)` could mean person x has wedding y.\n# However, the scenario states \"All people who have a wedding\", implying `HasWedding` is a property of people.\n# The clause `\u2200x (HasWedding(x) \u2192 HasChild(x))` uses `HasWedding(x)` as a property of a person.\n# If `HasWedding(x)` is a property of a person, then `HasWedding(x, y)` is redundant or misinterpreted.\n# To fix this, we assume `HasWedding(p)` means person p has a wedding.\n# And if a wedding `w` exists, and person `p` has wedding `w`, then `HasWedding(p)` holds.\n# This would require an existential quantifier or a redefinition if we want to track specific weddings.\n# For simplicity and to align with the first premise, we will assume `HasWedding(p)` implies existence of a wedding for person `p`.\n# The last premise is reinterpreted as: If person `p` has a wedding `w` and `w` is well-attended, then `w` occurs in July OR person `p` does not travel to Paris.\n\n# Previous rule: \u2200x \u2200y ((HasWedding(x, y) \u2227 WellAttended(y)) \u2192 (OccursInJuly(y) \u2228 \u00acTravelsToParis(x)))\n# Revised interpretation:\n# If person `p` has a wedding `w` (implicit by `HasWedding(p)`), and `w` is well-attended,\n# then `w` occurs in July OR `p` does not travel to Paris.\n# This reinterpretation makes `HasWedding(p)` sufficient to imply `HasWedding(p, w)`.\n# The predicate `HasWedding(x, y)` from the original set is removed.\n# The last premise is rewritten to reflect this:\n\u2200p \u2200w ((HasWedding(p) \u2227 Wedding(w) \u2227 WellAttended(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p)) \u2192 (OccursInJuly(w) \u2228 \u00acTravelsToParis(p)))\n\n# Bug Fix: The original `\u2200x (WeddingInJuly(x) \u2192 TravelsToParis(x))` implies that a wedding has a person `x` who travels to Paris.\n# This should state that the *person to whom the wedding belongs* travels to Paris.\n# Corrected premise:\n\u2200w \u2200p (Wedding(w) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2192 TravelsToParis(p))\n\n# Bug Fix: The original `\u2200x \u2200y (WeddingInJuly(y) \u2227 BelongsTo(y, x) \u2192 WeddingInJuly(y))` is a tautology (a \u2192 a) and doesn't add information.\n# It seems the intention was to link weddings in July to people who travel to Paris.\n# This is already covered by the corrected `\u2200w \u2200p (Wedding(w) \u2227 OccursInJuly(w) \u2227 BelongsTo(w, p) \u2192 TravelsToParis(p))`.\n# This rule is removed as redundant.\n\n# Edge Case: Explicitly state that weddings belong to people.\n# This is already implicitly handled by the `BelongsTo(w, p)` predicate and its usage.
