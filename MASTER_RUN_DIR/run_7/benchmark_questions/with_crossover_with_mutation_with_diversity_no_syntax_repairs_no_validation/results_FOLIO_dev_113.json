With the current premises:\n# `Donated(hardingpegmatitemine)` is true.\n# If we also had `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, texas)`, this rule would lead to a contradiction.\n# But we only have `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, picurismountains)`.\n# If we consider the transitive property of `LocatedIn`, then `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, texas)` can be inferred.\n# To avoid inferring `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, texas)` and thus contradiction, we should interpret the rule more strictly.\n# The original phrasing \"There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines which have been donated\"\n# suggests that the issue is with mines *within Texas*.\n# If `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, picurismountains)` and `LocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)`,\n# it means the mine is located in a mountain range that is in Texas.\n# The rule should capture this.\n# Let's assume `LocatedIn(x, y)` is not necessarily transitive, but direct location.\n# If the rule is `\u2200x ((Mine(x) \u2227 LocatedIn(x, texas)) \u2192 \u00acDonated(x))`, then `LocatedIn(x, texas)` must mean `x` is directly in the state.\n# The original program implicitly assumes `LocatedIn(picurismountains, newmexico)` is the *only* location, or at least the relevant one.\n# The note in the original program suggests simplifying by assuming it's *only* in NM.\n# To fix and add edge cases, let's consider the full implication of \"NM or TX\".\n\n# Option 1: Strict interpretation of the original rule's structure.\n# If `LocatedIn(x, texas)` implies direct location, then we need to make sure `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, texas)` is false.\n# This is already the case as only `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, picurismountains)` is given.\n# The \"NM or TX\" for Picuris Mountains is handled by:\n# `LocatedIn(picurismountains, newmexico)`\n# `LocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)`\n# This doesn't cause a contradiction as the mine is not *directly* located in Texas.\n\n# Option 2: More general rule capturing transitive location.\n# If `LocatedIn` is transitive, then `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, picurismountains)` and `LocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)` implies `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, texas)`.\n# To prevent contradiction, we'd need to negate `Donated(hardingpegmatitemine)` or adjust the premises.\n# Given the problem statement, we should not alter the fact that the mine *was* donated.\n# This implies that either `LocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)` is false, or the rule about Texas mines\n# is not meant to apply transitively in this context, or the mine is not considered to be in Texas.\n# The most faithful interpretation to avoid contradiction with existing facts is that the mine is not *directly* in Texas.\n\n# Let's adopt the formulation that treats `Texas(y)` as a predicate on the location itself,\n# and makes the rule more explicit about what \"in Texas\" means for a mine.\n\n# Premises:\nMountainRange(picurismountains)\nState(newmexico)\nState(texas)\n# The Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico.\nLocatedIn(picurismountains, newmexico)\n# The Picuris Mountains are ALSO in Texas. This covers the \"or Texas\" aspect.\nLocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)\nVisited(juandeonate, picurismountains)\nMine(hardingpegmatitemine)\nLocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, picurismountains)\nDonated(hardingpegmatitemine)\n# There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines which have been donated.\n# This implies that if a mine is located in Texas (directly or indirectly), it cannot have been donated.\n# To express \"mine is located in Texas\": `\u2203y (LocatedIn(mine, y) \u2227 Texas(y))`\n# The original rule `\u2200x ((Mine(x) \u2227 LocatedIn(x, texas)) \u2192 \u00acDonated(x))` implicitly means `LocatedIn(x, texas_constant)`.\n# A more robust rule would be:\n# If a mine `x` is located in `y`, and `y` is a state `s` such that `Texas(s)`, then `x` is not donated.\n\u2200x \u2200y ((Mine(x) \u2227 LocatedIn(x, y) \u2227 Texas(y)) \u2192 \u00acDonated(x))\n# This rule, combined with `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, picurismountains)` and `LocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)`,\n# would imply `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, texas)` if `LocatedIn` is transitive.\n# Given that `Donated(hardingpegmatitemine)` is true, this means `LocatedIn(hardingpegmatitemine, texas)` must be false.\n# Therefore, either `LocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)` is false (contradicting our premise) or\n# the inference that the mine is in Texas is blocked.\n# The most direct fix to make the premises consistent is to ensure the mine is not considered to be in Texas.\n# The statement \"There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines which have been donated\"\n# can be interpreted as: For any `mountain_range`, if `mountain_range` is in `texas`, then there is no `mine` `m` such that `LocatedIn(m, mountain_range)` and `Donated(m)`.\n# \u2200mr \u2200tx ((MountainRange(mr) \u2227 LocatedIn(mr, tx) \u2227 Texas(tx)) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203m (Mine(m) \u2227 LocatedIn(m, mr) \u2227 Donated(m)))\n# This is a different structure. Let's stick to the original structure's intent.\n\n# The simplest fix, adhering to the original rule's style:\n# The rule `\u2200x ((Mine(x) \u2227 LocatedIn(x, texas)) \u2192 \u00acDonated(x))` implies that if a mine is directly located in the state of Texas, it's not donated.\n# The problem states the Picuris Mountains are in NM *or* TX.\n# We have `LocatedIn(picurismountains, newmexico)`.\n# Let's add `LocatedIn(picurismountains, texas)` to represent the \"or TX\" part.\n# The rule states \"no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines which have been donated.\"\n# This implies that if a mine is located *in Texas*, it's not donated.\n# The crucial part is what `LocatedIn(x, texas)` means.\n# If it means directly located in the state, then the current setup is fine.\n# If it implies transitively, then we have a problem.\n# The most likely intended meaning is that if the mine's location *is* Texas, then it's not donated.\n\n# Final decision: Use the original rule structure but ensure the predicates correctly represent the information.\n# The phrase \"mountain ranges in texas that have mines\" suggests a connection to the state of Texas.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac\u2203x (LocatedIn(HardingPegmatiteMine, x) \u2227 MountainRange(x) \u2227 LocatedIn(x, NewMexico))\n",
