The intent is that Basque is isolated.\n# The current formulation addresses this by ensuring it's not related to *any other* language.\n# This implicitly allows it to be related to itself, which is usually true for any relation.\n# However, if the intent is that Basque is *completely* unrelated, even to itself by definition,\n# that's a stronger claim. The current premise is more standard.\n# If Basque is unrelated to any *other* language, and we define `Related(x,x)` as true\n# (which is typical for relations and implied by the language family rule if Basque were in a family),\n# then Basque is related to itself.\n# Let's assume for clarity that if Basque is not related to any *other* language, it could be related to itself.\n# If Basque is a language, it should be related to itself by reflexivity,\n# unless explicitly stated otherwise. The current premise allows this.\n# The premise `\u2200x (Basque(x) \u2192 \u00ac\u2203y (Language(y) \u2227 \u00ac(x = y) \u2227 Related(x, y)))` means\n# \"For any x, if x is Basque, then there is no y such that y is a language AND y is not equal to x AND x is related to y.\"\n# This correctly states that Basque is not related to any *other* language.\n\n# Conclusion:\nRomanceLanguage(french) \u2192 IndoEuropeanLanguage(french)\n",
