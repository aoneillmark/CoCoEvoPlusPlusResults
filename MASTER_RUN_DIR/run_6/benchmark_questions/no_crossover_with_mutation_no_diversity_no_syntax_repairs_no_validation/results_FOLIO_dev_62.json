However, it explicitly captures the scenario's statement about F1 visa holders.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he needs CPT or OPT. This is consistent with him needing CPT if he wants to work.\n# The rule \"Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\" can be seen as a specific instance of the more general rule for F1 visa holders when they choose CPT.\n# The crucial aspect here is that the scenario states \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" This is a direct statement about Mike's needs.\n# The rule for F1 visa holders adds that they *also* have the option or requirement of OPT.\n\n# The previous version's logic regarding redundancy between general working rules and F1-specific rules is considered. This revision prioritizes capturing all explicit statements from the scenario, including the specific one about Mike, and the general rule for F1 visa holders.\n# The rule `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` from the previous version is implicitly covered by `Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())` for Mike. The F1 visa rule adds to this by allowing OPT as well.\n# To be most precise to the prompt, we keep the explicit statement about Mike and the explicit statement about F1 visa holders.\n\n# Updated interpretation:\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is a direct assertion about Mike.\n# The statement \"An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if they want to work in the US\" is a general rule for a class of students.\n# These two statements are distinct. We should ensure both are represented.\n# The `Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())` captures the specific assertion about Mike.\n# The `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT())))` captures the general rule for F1 students.\n# If Mike has an F1 visa and wants to work, he satisfies both conditions. This implies he needs CPT (from the first rule) and he needs CPT or OPT (from the second rule). This is consistent.\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",
