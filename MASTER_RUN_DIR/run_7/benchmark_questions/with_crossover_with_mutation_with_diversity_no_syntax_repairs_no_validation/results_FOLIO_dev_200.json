A more robust encoding might use equality or a named individual\n# consistently. Given the phrasing \"Ailton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.

The simplest way given the current predicates is to assume they refer to the same entity\n# in the context of football. The premise `FootballPlayer(Ailton)` in the original code suggests this.\n\n# Let's make the connection between Ailton Silva and Ailton more explicit for player status if needed,\n# but the current premises might imply it through consistent use of Ailton for player actions.\n# The original code had:\n# FootballPlayer(Ailton) # Derived from \"Ailton is a football player.\"\n# LoanedTo(Ailton, Braga) # Derived from \"Ailton ... was loaned out to Braga.\"\n# This implies Ailton is a player.\n# And AiltonSilva is also a player.\n# The problem is that `Ailton` and `AiltonSilva` might be treated as separate entities if not handled.\n# The most direct interpretation is that `Ailton` is an alias for `AiltonSilva`.\n\n# Let's assume `ailton` and `ailton_silva` are indeed the same individual for player-related facts.\n# The original premises already use `Ailton` for `LoanedTo` and `AiltonSilva` for `PlaysFor` and `Brazilian`.\n# To avoid redundancy and ensure the alias is handled gracefully, we can ensure `FootballPlayer` applies to the alias.\n\n# The duplicate `FootballPlayer(Ailton)` in the original 'Additional Premises derived from the text' section is removed.\n# The original `FootballPlayer(Ailton)` premise is kept as it is directly stated in the text.\n# The original `Brazilian(AiltonSilva)` and `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico)` are also kept.\n# These directly reflect the text and don't need to be in \"Additional Premises\".\n\n# The problem description states:\n# \"Ailton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.
