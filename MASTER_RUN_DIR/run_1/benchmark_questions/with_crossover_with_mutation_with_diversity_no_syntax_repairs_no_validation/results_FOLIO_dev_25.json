The most specific are the 2008 ones.\n# The general statement \"has hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics\" could mean there are other unspecified instances.\n# For simplification, let's assume the general statement means Beijing hosted *some* Summer Olympics and *some* Winter Olympics (and Paralympics).\n# Given the context mentioning 2008, and then a general statement, it's reasonable to assume the general statement reinforces the fact that Beijing has this capability and history.\n# If the goal is to be precise without making assumptions beyond the text, and given the original program *did* include `Hosted(beijing, SummerOlympics)`, `Hosted(beijing, WinterOlympics)`, etc., without years, we can follow that pattern for consistency with the implied scope.\n# Let's refine based on \"hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics, along with the Summer and Winter Paralympics\" to be more explicit about distinct events.\n\n# Revised approach for hosting events:\n# The 2008 events are clearly specified.\n# The general statement \"has hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics, along with the Summer and Winter Paralympics\" suggests distinct hosting instances for each category.\n# Let's explicitly list these categories being hosted.\n\nHost(beijing, summerOlympics).\nHost(beijing, winterOlympics).\nHost(beijing, summerParalympics).\nHost(beijing, winterParalympics).\n\n# Regarding universities: \"Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.\"\n# This implies existence of universities, and that these universities rank well.\n# The original used `HasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, asiaPacific)` and `HasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, world)`.\n# This is a bit of a high-level predicate.

The most specific are the 2008 ones.\n# The general statement \"has hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics\" could mean there are other unspecified instances.\n# For simplification, let's assume the general statement means Beijing hosted *some* Summer Olympics and *some* Winter Olympics (and Paralympics).\n# Given the context mentioning 2008, and then a general statement, it's reasonable to assume the general statement reinforces the fact that Beijing has this capability and history.\n# If the goal is to be precise without making assumptions beyond the text, and given the original program *did* include `Hosted(beijing, SummerOlympics)`, `Hosted(beijing, WinterOlympics)`, etc., without years, we can follow that pattern for consistency with the implied scope.\n# Let's refine based on \"hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics, along with the Summer and Winter Paralympics\" to be more explicit about distinct events.\n\n# Revised approach for hosting events:\n# The 2008 events are clearly specified.\n# The general statement \"has hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics, along with the Summer and Winter Paralympics\" suggests distinct hosting instances for each category.\n# Let's explicitly list these categories being hosted.\n\nHost(beijing, summerOlympics).\nHost(beijing, winterOlympics).\nHost(beijing, summerParalympics).\nHost(beijing, winterParalympics).\n\n# Regarding universities: \"Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.\"\n# This implies existence of universities, and that these universities rank well.\n# The original used `HasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, asiaPacific)` and `HasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, world)`.\n# This is a bit of a high-level predicate. Let's try to be more grounded if possible without adding too many new predicates.\n# The simplified `University(u) :- BejingHasUniversity(u)` and `Rank(u, asiaPacific) :- BejingHasUniversity(u)` is a good way to represent this.\n# The \"many\" can be represented by having multiple instances of `BejingHasUniversity` or by a single fact representing the aggregation.\n# For premises, it's often simpler to use a predicate that captures the essence directly, or a helper as done above.\n# The original predicates like `HasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest` are arguably more descriptive of the scenario statement.\n# Let's stick to simpler predicates if possible, but ensure the information is captured.\n\n# Re-evaluation of the university premises:\n# The original premises `HasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, asiaPacific)` and `HasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, world)` directly map to the sentence.\n# Let's use these for directness and simplicity in this context.\n\nHasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, asiaPacific).\nHasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, world).\n\n# Consolidating and simplifying the premises:\n# Remove redundancy and clarify.\n# The statement \"Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city\" implies both populousness and being a national capital.\n# `NationalCapital(beijing, peopleRepublicOfChina)` covers the capital aspect.\n# `Populous(beijing)` covers the populous aspect.\n\n# Final simplified set of premises:\nNationalCapital(beijing, peopleRepublicOfChina).\nPopulous(beijing).\nLocation(beijing, northernChina).\nHost(beijing, games2008SummerOlympics).\nHost(beijing, games2008SummerParalympics).\nHost(beijing, summerOlympics).\nHost(beijing, winterOlympics).\nHost(beijing, summerParalympics).\nHost(beijing, winterParalympics).\nHasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, asiaPacific).\nHasManyUniversitiesWithRankAmongBest(beijing, world).\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u00ac(\u2203x (Country(x) \u2227 NationalCapital(beijing, x) \u2227 Populous(x)))\n",
