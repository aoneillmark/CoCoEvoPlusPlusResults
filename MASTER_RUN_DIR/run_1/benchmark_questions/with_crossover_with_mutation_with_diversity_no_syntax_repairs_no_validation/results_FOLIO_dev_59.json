So `In(x, butte)` means `x is in the city of Butte`. This is still strange.\n# A more sensible interpretation, given the context is about cities and states, is that the premise is trying to say:\n# If a city `c` is in `montana`, then `c` is not `pierre`. This is already covered by `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)`.\n# Or, if a city `c` is in `montana`, then `c` is not in the `city` of Pierre. This is also covered by `\u00acIn(pierre, montana)`.\n# Let's consider the original statement: \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre.\"\n# If `In(x, butte)` means `x is in the city of Butte`, and `In(x, pierre)` means `x is in the city of Pierre`.\n# Then the premise `\u2200x (In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` implies that no city can be located within both the city of Butte and the city of Pierre. This is a reasonable spatial exclusion.\n# However, given the other `In` relations are `In(city, state)`, it's more likely that `In(x, butte)` was intended to mean `x is in the state of Butte` or `x is Butte`.\n# Since Butte is a city, not a state in this context, and `In(x, y)` is usually `City(x)` and `State(y)`, this premise is problematic.\n# Let's assume the intent was to ensure that the city of Butte is not the same as the city of Pierre, and that if a city is associated with Butte (e.g., `In(x, state_of_butte)`), it's not in Pierre.\n# Given the limited predicates, and `In(x,y)` being `x is in y`, where `y` can be a state.\n# The sentence \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre\" is most likely a misstatement of \"The city of Butte is not in the city of Pierre\", or \"The city of Butte is not the city of Pierre\".\n# Let's reinterpret the problematic premise: `\u2200x (In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))`\n# If `In(x, butte)` means `x is the city of Butte` (i.e. `x = butte`), then `\u2200x (x=butte \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` becomes `\u00acIn(butte, pierre)`.\n# But Pierre is a city, not a state. So `In(butte, pierre)` is like saying \"Butte is in the city of Pierre\". This implies `City(butte)` and `City(pierre)`.\n# If we interpret `In(x, y)` where `y` is a city to mean `x is the same city as y` or `x is located within the boundaries of city y`, the premise is still strange.\n# Let's assume the intent is that the entity \"Butte\" (as a city) is distinct from the entity \"Pierre\" (as a city).\n# The statement \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre\" suggests a constraint on the location of cities relative to other cities.\n# If `In(x, state)` means city x is in state, and `In(city1, city2)` is not defined, this premise is problematic.\n# However, the scenario states \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre\". Let's assume `In(x, butte)` refers to `x` being a city within the region of `butte`.\n# Given the context, `In(city, state)` is the primary use.\n# The most sensible interpretation of \"Any city in Butte is not in Pierre\" given the other premises is that the city of Butte is not the same as the city of Pierre, and no other city is located in both Butte and Pierre.\n# Since `In` is used for `City(x)` in `State(y)`, the premise `\u2200x (In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` is likely a mistake or a poorly formulated rule.\n# If we assume `In(x, y)` when `y` is a city means `x` is the same as `y`, then `\u2200x (x = butte \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` meaning `\u00acIn(butte, pierre)`.\n# But `In(butte, pierre)` is like saying `butte` is in the city of `pierre`. This is very strange.\n# Let's re-evaluate the original premise: `\u2200x (In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))`\n# This statement implies that if `x` is a city and `x` is in `butte`, then `x` is not in `pierre`.\n# Given the other premises, `In(x, y)` is primarily used as `City(x)` is in `State(y)`.\n# The premise `In(butte, montana)` is given.\n# If `In(x, butte)` meant `x is in the state of Butte`, this would be a separate state.

If `y` is a city, it's strange.\n# Let's remove it for simplicity and focus on the state relations, as `In(x, butte)` and `In(x, pierre)` are not well-defined in the context of `City` in `State`.\n# If we assume `In(x,y)` is always `City(x)` and `State(y)`, then `In(x, butte)` can never be true because `butte` is `City`.\n# This makes the premise `\u2200x (In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre))` vacuously true and thus redundant/buggy.\n\n# Revised Premises (Simplified and corrected):\nCity(billings)\nCity(butte)\nCity(helena)\nCity(missoula)\nCity(white_sulphur_springs)\nCity(pierre)\nState(montana)\n\nIn(billings, montana)\n\n# If a city is in Montana, it is a city.\n\u2200x (In(x, montana) \u2192 City(x))\n\n# Explicitly state Montana cities.\nIn(butte, montana)\nIn(helena, montana)\nIn(missoula, montana)\n\n# White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state.\nSameState(white_sulphur_springs, butte)\n\n# If two cities are in the same state, they are both in Montana OR both not in Montana.\n# Since Butte is in Montana, White Sulphur Springs must also be in Montana.\n\u2200x \u2200y (SameState(x, y) \u2192 (In(x, montana) \u2194 In(y, montana)))\n\n# Pierre is not in Montana.\n\u00acIn(pierre, montana)\n\n# Removed: \u2200x (In(x, butte) \u2192 \u00acIn(x, pierre)) as it's ill-formed with In(City, State) usage.\n# If the intent was spatial disjointness of cities, a different predicate might be needed, or specific facts about cities.\n# The current premises already establish that `butte` is in `montana` and `pierre` is not.\n# The relation between `butte` and `pierre` as cities, if `In(city, city)` is meant, is not clarified and the original statement is problematic.\n# For the scope of `City` in `State`, the premise is not applicable or vacuously true.\n\n# Conclusion:\nIn(missoula, montana)\n",
