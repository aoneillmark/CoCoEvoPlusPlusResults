If simplification were the primary goal, one could potentially combine conditions, but given the specific requirements stated, the current structure is clear.\n\n3.  **No Missing Edge Cases**: The provided scenario covers the core logic: international students in the US with F1/J1 visas, and the specific requirement for F1 visa holders to apply for CPT/OPT if they want to work. Mike's specific situation is also encoded.\n\nThe provided solution below maintains the original structure and vocabulary, simply removing the redundant premise.\n\n================  PROGRAM  ================\n# Premises:\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nPerson(mike)\nF1Visa(mike) \u2228 J1Visa(mike)\nWork(mike)\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))\n===========================================\n\n# Conclusion:\nJ1Visa(mike)\n",

If we know Mike has an F1 visa, the first rule gives us CPT or OPT.\n# The second rule specifically states CPT. This suggests CPT is a mandatory application if working.\n\n# Let's simplify based on direct statements and implications.\n# We know Mike is an international student and in the US.\n# We know he wants to work.\n# The statement \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US\" is a direct implication for Mike.\nInternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# Given F1Visa(mike) from the original program context (though not explicitly in premises, it's implied by the context and the subsequent rule about F1 visa holders).\n# If Mike has an F1 visa, wants to work, and is an international student in the US, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT.\n# The rule above already specifies CPT. If CPT is chosen, the condition is satisfied.\n\n# The premise \u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 \u00acInternationalStudent(x)) is contradictory to InternationalStudent(mike).\n# If Mike is a person, he cannot be an international student.\n# Assuming the intention is that Mike is an international student, and we should disregard this premise if it creates a contradiction.\n# For this exercise, we assume InternationalStudent(mike) is the intended fact.\n\n# Therefore, the most direct and non-redundant premises capturing the scenario are:\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nWork(mike)\nF1Visa(mike) # Assuming this is meant to be a fact given the problem description.\n\n# If Mike is an international student in the US and wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT.\nInternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# If Mike is an international student in the US with an F1 visa and wants to work, he needs to apply for CPT or OPT.\n# This rule is consistent with the above, as CPT is one of the options.\n\n# Re-evaluating the provided premises for simplification and bug fixing.\n# The premise `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x)) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))` is general.\n# The premise `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` is also general.\n# Given `InternationalStudent(mike)`, `US(mike)`, `Work(mike)`, and `F1Visa(mike)`, both general rules apply to Mike.\n# The second general rule `\u2200x (InternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 NeedsToApply(x, CPT()))` is stronger and directly implies `NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())`.\n\n# Let's make the premises as minimal as possible while capturing the logic.\n# We are given Mike is an international student and in the US.\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\n\n# We are given Mike wants to work.\nWork(mike)\n\n# An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if they want to work.\n# This implies if Mike has F1, works, and is international in US, he needs CPT or OPT.\nF1Visa(mike) # Assuming this is a known fact for Mike.\nInternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n\n# Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\n# This is a specific statement about Mike.\n# If Mike is an international student in the US and works, he needs CPT.\nInternationalStudent(mike) \u2227 US(mike) \u2227 Work(mike) \u2192 NeedsToApply(mike, CPT())\n\n# The premise `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2192 \u00acInternationalStudent(x))` is problematic if Mike is both a Person and an InternationalStudent.\n# Assuming that the intent is that Mike is an international student, and the `Person(x)` predicate might be for other individuals or irrelevant for Mike's case.\n# We will keep the `InternationalStudent(mike)` premise and omit the problematic `Person` premise to avoid contradiction.\n\n# Final revised premises to be concise and fix potential issues:\nInternationalStudent(mike)\nUS(mike)\nWork(mike)\nF1Visa(mike) # Explicitly stating as a premise as it's used in rules applicable to Mike.\n\n# Rule: International students in US with F1 visa need CPT or OPT to work.\nInternationalStudent(x) \u2227 US(x) \u2227 F1Visa(x) \u2227 Work(x) \u2192 (NeedsToApply(x, CPT()) \u2228 NeedsToApply(x, OPT()))\n\n# Rule: Mike needs CPT if he wants to work.
