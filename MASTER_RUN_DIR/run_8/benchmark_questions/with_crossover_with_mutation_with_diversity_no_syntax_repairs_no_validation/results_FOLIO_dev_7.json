Let `g` be an instance of a glu.

Fix the `FeelTiredWhen` premise: `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))` is buggy.\n#    Revised: `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))`\n# 2. Rename `SymptomOf` to `IsSymptomOf` for better readability and to avoid ambiguity with the disease object.\n#    This also aligns with the pattern of `CausedBy`.\n# 3. Ensure consistent predicate naming. `FeelingTired` is fine, but `FeelTiredWhen` is awkward.\n#    If we keep `FeelTiredWhen`, the revised premise is crucial.\n\n# Re-evaluating the \"Glu\" premise:\n# Original: `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))`\n# The intent is: If a person `x` experiences a `Glu` (let's call the instance `g`), then `x` feels tired.\n# So, we need to state that there exists a `glu` instance.\n# Let `x` be a person. Let `g` be an instance of a glu. If `x` gets `g`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This implies a relationship between `Person`, `Glu`, and the act of \"getting\".\n# Let's assume `Glu(g)` implies `g` is an instance of a glu.\n# And `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` means person `p` feels tired when `g` is present/experienced.\n# So, `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))` correctly captures that any person `p` will feel tired if there's any glu `g` that they \"get\".\n# This is a reasonable simplification.\n\n# Let's adjust the symptom predicates for consistency.\n# `SymptomOf(x, y)` where `x` is a symptom and `y` is the disease.\n# `Fever` is a symptom of `Monkeypox`.\n# `\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 (SymptomOf(Fever, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(Headache, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(MusclePains, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)))`\n# This implies that `Fever`, `Headache`, etc., are properties or instances that can be symptoms of the disease *Monkeypox*.\n# It's a bit abstract, as symptoms are usually experienced by an organism.\n# A more standard representation: `\u2200d (Monkeypox(d) \u2192 \u2200s (IsSymptom(s, d) \u2192 (s=Fever \u2228 s=Headache \u2228 ...)))`\n# But the current form is acceptable if `Fever`, `Headache`, etc., are treated as abstract symptom entities.\n# Let's assume `Fever`, `Headache`, `MusclePains`, `FeelingTired` are constants representing the symptoms.\n# The original phrasing `SymptomOf(Fever, x)` means `Fever` is a symptom of `x`.\n\n# Final check of premises for bugs and edge cases:\n# 1. `Monkeypox(mpox) \u2227 InfectiousDisease(mpox) \u2227 CausedBy(mpox, mpox_virus)`: OK.\n# 2. `MonkeypoxVirus(mpox_virus) \u2227 OccurIn(mpox_virus, humans) \u2227 OccurIn(mpox_virus, animals)`: OK.\n# 3. `\u2200x (Human(x) \u2192 Mammal(x))`: OK.\n# 4. `\u2200x (Mammal(x) \u2192 Animal(x))`: OK.\n# 5. `\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 (SymptomOf(Fever, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(Headache, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(MusclePains, x) \u2227 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)))`: This states that if `x` is Monkeypox, then `Fever` is a symptom of `x`. This is abstract but consistent within the current predicate usage.\n# 6. `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))`: BUG. `Glu(x)` is used for both the condition on `x` and the argument to `FeelTiredWhen`.\n\n# Fix for premise 6:\n# Interpret `Glu(g)` as `g` is an instance of a glu.\n# Interpret `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` as person `p` feels tired when experiencing `g`.\n# Premise: `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))`\n\n# Let's refine the vocabulary slightly and make minimal changes.\n# The term \"Glu\" is unusual; let's assume it's a specific ailment or condition that causes tiredness.\n\n# Consider if \"FeelingTired\" is a symptom of Monkeypox, does it mean *any* person with Monkeypox feels tired?\n# The current premise implies this. This is likely intended.\n\n# Let's make the predicate names more parallel where possible.\n# `SymptomOf(symptom, disease)` is okay. `CausedBy(disease, agent)` is okay.\n# `OccurIn(agent, host)` is okay.\n\n# The main bug is premise 6. The rest seems logically consistent with the described scenario, even if abstract.\n# The task asks to simplify logic and fix bugs.\n\n# Minimal change for bug fix:\n# Original: `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))`\n# Revised: `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))`\n# This change requires introducing a new variable `g` and changing `x` to `p` for clarity regarding persons.\n\n# Let's also ensure consistency in naming the \"feeling tired\" symptom.\n# In premise 5, it's `FeelingTired`. In premise 6, it's `FeelTiredWhen`.\n# This isn't a bug, but a naming inconsistency.\n# If `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` implies `FeelingTired(p)`, then it's fine.\n# Let's assume `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` implies `FeelingTired(p)`.\n\n# Alternative simplification for symptom premise:\n# Instead of `Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)`, we can say:\n# If `x` is Monkeypox, and `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `x`, then a person `p` having `x` feels tired.\n# This requires relating a person to the disease instance.\n# However, the current premise is more direct: the disease itself has symptoms listed.\n\n# Let's focus on the bug.\n# The original premise: `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))`\n# The intent is that if `x` is a person and `g` is an instance of `Glu`, then `x` feels tired when experiencing `g`.\n# So, `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))` is the correct fix.\n\n# Let's make the vocabulary consistent with the symptoms listed in premise 5.\n# Premise 5 lists `FeelingTired`. Premise 6 talks about people feeling tired.\n# Let's align them.\n# Predicate: FeelingTired(x) ::: x feels tired.\n# Premise: `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelingTired(p))`\n# This interpretation assumes that `Glu(g)` is a direct cause of `FeelingTired(p)`.\n# The predicate `FeelTiredWhen` suggests a specific event or condition.\n\n# Let's keep `FeelTiredWhen` as it's in the original.\n# `FeelTiredWhen(p, g)` means person `p` feels tired when `g` occurs.\n# So, the fix `\u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))` is the most direct correction of the bug in premise 6, while keeping the original predicate.\n\n# Final check on consistency:\n# `FeelingTired(x)` is a symptom.\n# `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` is a predicate about feeling tired due to something.\n# This is fine.

Let's assume 'get_glu(p, g)' represents person 'p' getting glu 'g'.\n# But the original predicate is FeelTiredWhen(x, y) where x is person and y is the cause.\n# So, \u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g)). This implies the glu itself causes tiredness.\n# The connection to Monkeypox is that FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n\n# To simplify and stick to the provided predicates and scenario, we can directly state\n# that 'FeelingTired' is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The information about 'glu' and feeling tired when getting a glu seems like a separate fact\n# about how people experience tiredness. It doesn't directly link 'glu' as a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# However, if the intention is to infer that a specific instance of feeling tired\n# from Monkeypox *is an instance of* feeling tired from a glu, that would require more complex modeling.\n\n# Based on the original structure, the intent seems to be to list symptoms.\n# The \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" statement might be context for understanding 'FeelingTired'.\n# We already have FeelingTired as a symptom.\n# If we want to link 'glu' to Monkeypox, we need an explicit connection.\n# The current statement doesn't imply that 'glu' is a symptom or caused by Monkeypox.\n# It simply describes a condition under which people feel tired.\n\n# Re-evaluating the original intent:\n# \"Symptons of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and so on.

Let's assume 'get_glu(p, g)' represents person 'p' getting glu 'g'.\n# But the original predicate is FeelTiredWhen(x, y) where x is person and y is the cause.\n# So, \u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g)). This implies the glu itself causes tiredness.\n# The connection to Monkeypox is that FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n\n# To simplify and stick to the provided predicates and scenario, we can directly state\n# that 'FeelingTired' is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The information about 'glu' and feeling tired when getting a glu seems like a separate fact\n# about how people experience tiredness. It doesn't directly link 'glu' as a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# However, if the intention is to infer that a specific instance of feeling tired\n# from Monkeypox *is an instance of* feeling tired from a glu, that would require more complex modeling.\n\n# Based on the original structure, the intent seems to be to list symptoms.\n# The \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" statement might be context for understanding 'FeelingTired'.\n# We already have FeelingTired as a symptom.\n# If we want to link 'glu' to Monkeypox, we need an explicit connection.\n# The current statement doesn't imply that 'glu' is a symptom or caused by Monkeypox.\n# It simply describes a condition under which people feel tired.\n\n# Re-evaluating the original intent:\n# \"Symptons of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and so on. People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This suggests that FeelingTired is a symptom, and this tiredness can be understood in the context of getting a glu.\n# The original program directly listed FeelingTired as a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# The statement about 'glu' might be redundant or intended to be a separate fact.\n# Let's keep the direct assertion that FeelingTired is a symptom.\n\n# The original program also had:\n# \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)).\n# This is a good way to represent it.\n\n# If we want to use the 'FeelTiredWhen' predicate, it implies a temporal or causal relationship.\n# For example, if a person has Monkeypox, they experience feeling tired.\n# And if they get a glu, they feel tired.\n# The relation between these two might be subtle.\n# Let's assume the scenario implies that the 'feeling tired' symptom of Monkeypox *is* an instance\n# of feeling tired, and this feeling tired can be characterized by the 'glu' example.\n# However, without more information, linking 'glu' to Monkeypox itself is speculative.\n\n# Let's simplify and ensure the core facts are captured:\n# Monkeypox is an infectious disease.\n\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 InfectiousDisease(x)).\n\n# Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus.\n\u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 \u2203v (CausedBy(x, v) \u2227 MonkeypoxVirus(v))).\n# This is a good representation.\n\n# Let's refine the symptom representation. The original had \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(Symptom, x)).\n# This implies that for *any* instance of Monkeypox, a specific symptom (like Fever) is a symptom of it.\n# This is better represented by instantiating 'mpox' and asserting its symptoms directly, or by stating the general rule.\n# The original phrasing might imply that 'Fever' as a concept is a symptom of any Monkeypox instance.\n\n# A more standard way to represent \"SymptomOf(Symptom, Disease)\" is often to say\n# \"If X is a Disease, then X has Symptom S\".\n# Or, if the predicates are for specific instances:\n# SymptomOf(Fever_instance_1, mpox_instance_1).\n# However, the provided predicates are general concepts (Fever, Headache).\n# So, \u2200x (Monkeypox(x) \u2192 SymptomOf(Fever, x)) means Fever is a symptom of any Monkeypox.\n# This is a good way to represent it.\n\n# Let's re-examine the `FeelTiredWhen` predicate:\n# \u2200p, g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g)).\n# This states that any person, if they have a glu, feels tired.\n# We know FeelingTired is a symptom of Monkeypox.\n# And people are humans, humans are mammals, mammals are animals.\n# Monkeypox can occur in humans and animals.\n\n# If we want to use FeelTiredWhen, we need to connect it to Monkeypox.\n# The simplest interpretation that uses the predicate is that if a person has Monkeypox,\n# they experience feeling tired.
