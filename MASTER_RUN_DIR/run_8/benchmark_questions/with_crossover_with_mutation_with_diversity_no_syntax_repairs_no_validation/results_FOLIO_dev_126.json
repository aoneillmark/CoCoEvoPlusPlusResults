Edge-cases: The premises cover general rules and specific facts about 'rock'.\n#    The interaction between Rock being an Animal and Rock breathing is handled by the last premise\n#    which effectively prevents Rock from being an Animal if it's not a bird and doesn't fly.\n#    The explicit given facts \u00acBird(rock) and \u00acFlies(rock) are crucial.\n# 3. Logic simplification: The conversion of the English sentence to a logical formula is simplified.\n\n# The premises are sound and represent the scenario as described.\n# No further simplification appears necessary without adding new assumptions.\n# The premises clearly define relationships and specific states for 'rock',\n# leading to potential contradictions or strong inferences about 'rock's classification\n# if one were to try and prove properties about it.\n# For instance, from the given premises, we can derive \u00acBreathes(rock) and \u00acHasWings(rock).\n# If we tried to prove Rock is an Animal, we'd have a contradiction.\n\n# Final check of requirements:\n# - New program, different from the original: Yes, the simplification of the last premise is a change.\n# - Correct format: Yes, # Premises: section.\n# - No other sections: Yes.\n# - Keep vocabulary: Yes.\n\n# The original program had:\n# \u00acBird(rock)\n# \u00acFlies(rock)\n# (\u00acBird(rock) \u2227 \u00acFlies(rock)) \u2192 \u00acBreathes(rock)\n# This means the last premise was *already* simplified in the original prompt!\n# My initial analysis assumed the original prompt's \"CURRENT PROGRAM\" might have had a less simplified version.\n\n# Let's re-read the prompt's \"CURRENT PROGRAM\":\n# \u00acBird(rock)\n# \u00acFlies(rock)\n# (\u00acBird(rock) \u2227 \u00acFlies(rock)) \u2192 \u00acBreathes(rock)\n# This IS the simplified form of the last sentence.\n\n# So, the task is to write a *new* program that is *different* from this program,\n# which satisfies the same problem.\n# This implies we need to change the encoding, perhaps by using different logical forms or axioms,\n# while retaining the same meaning.\n\n# Let's try a different approach for the \"Animal is either a monkey or a bird\" rule.\n# The current is \u2200x (Animal(x) \u2192 (Monkey(x) \u2228 Bird(x))).
