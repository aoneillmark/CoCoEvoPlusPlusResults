This is circular and incorrect.\n\n# A better representation of \"People feel tired when they get a glu\":\n# Let's assume 'Glu' is a condition or event that affects a person.\n# If x is a person, and x has a glu, then x feels tired.\n# If we introduce `Has(x, y)`: x has y.\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Has(x, glu_instance) \u2227 Glu(glu_instance) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, glu_instance))\n# This still requires `Has` and `glu_instance`.\n\n# Re-interpreting the original:\n# `FeelingTired(x)` means x is feeling tired.\n# `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` means x feels tired when they get y.\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# For any person `p`, if `p` gets `g` and `g` is a `Glu`, then `p` feels tired (as a result of getting `g`).\n# We can try to capture this by saying that 'Glu' is a condition that causes tiredness in people.\n# Let's assume 'Glu' is a type of ailment.\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 (gets_ailment(p, Glu) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu)))\n# This requires a `gets_ailment` predicate.\n\n# Simplest interpretation that fits the predicates:\n# If `FeelingTired` is a symptom, and `Glu` is something that causes tiredness,\n# then `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Glu`.\n# `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)` means FeelingTired is a symptom of x.\n# If `Glu` is a disease/condition, then `FeelingTired` could be a symptom of `Glu`.\n# So, `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, glu_condition)`.\n# And \"people feel tired when they get a glu\".\n# This is about the *experience* of a person.\n\n# Let's assume the original `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))` was an attempt to say:\n# If `x` is a person AND `x` is afflicted by `Glu` (i.e., `Glu(x)` means `x` has `Glu`),\n# THEN `x` feels tired when they get `Glu`.\n# This still requires `Glu(x)` to mean \"x has Glu\" and `FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x))` to mean \"x feels tired when they get Glu\".\n\n# Let's rephrase the last premise to be clearer, assuming `Glu` represents a condition one can contract.\n# If `x` is a person and `x` contracts `g`, and `g` is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This requires a `contracts` predicate.\n\n# Given the structure, perhaps the intent was that `Glu(x)` means `x` is a glu, and people get \"things\" that are glus.\n# So, for any person `p`, if `p` gets some `g` and `g` is a `Glu`, then `p` feels tired.\n# `\u2200p \u2200g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2227 Gets(p, g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))`\n# We lack `Gets`.\n\n# Let's go back to the original structure and see if a minimal fix can be made.\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))`\n# If `Glu(x)` implies `x` is a *glu* (an instance), and `FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x))` implies `x` feels tired when they get that `Glu(x)` instance.\n# This is still flawed. The problem is quantifying `Glu(x)` in the consequent as the thing being gotten.\n\n# A simpler approach for the last premise:\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This can be rephrased as: For any person `p`, and for any `g` that is a `Glu`, `p` feels tired when they experience `g`.\n# Let's stick to the original predicate names. If `FeelingTired` is a state, and `Glu` is a condition, this means a person in the state `Glu` feels tired.\n# Let's assume `Glu(x)` represents a person *having* a glu.\n# Then `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n# This simplifies the original but doesn't use `FeelTiredWhen`.\n\n# If we MUST use `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)`, then `y` must be something that can be \"gotten\".\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This implies that the act of getting a glu causes tiredness.\n# Let's represent 'getting a glu' by an event or a state related to `Glu`.\n# If we consider `Glu` itself as the entity that is \"gotten\".\n# `\u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu))` This states every person feels tired when they get 'Glu' (the concept). Not quite right.\n\n# The best interpretation given the predicates:\n# For any person `p`, if `p` gets something which is a `Glu`, then `p` feels tired.\n# Let `x` be an instance of \"getting a glu\".\n# `\u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 \u2203x (IsGettingAGlu(x, p) \u2227 FeelTiredWhen(p, x)))`\n# We don't have `IsGettingAGlu`.\n\n# Let's assume `Glu` can be used as an event or condition.\n# `\u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu))` - This is still awkward.\n\n# The most direct interpretation of the sentence \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" using the available predicates\n# is to assume that `Glu(x)` represents \"x is a glu\" and `FeelTiredWhen(y, x)` means \"y feels tired when they get x\".\n# So, for any person `p`, and any `g` that is a `Glu`, `p` feels tired when they get `g`.\n# `\u2200p \u2200g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))` This seems like the most appropriate correction to the problematic last premise.\n\n# Revised premises based on this understanding:\n# Define specific instances for clarity, or keep general.

This is circular and incorrect.\n\n# A better representation of \"People feel tired when they get a glu\":\n# Let's assume 'Glu' is a condition or event that affects a person.\n# If x is a person, and x has a glu, then x feels tired.\n# If we introduce `Has(x, y)`: x has y.\n# \u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Has(x, glu_instance) \u2227 Glu(glu_instance) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, glu_instance))\n# This still requires `Has` and `glu_instance`.\n\n# Re-interpreting the original:\n# `FeelingTired(x)` means x is feeling tired.\n# `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)` means x feels tired when they get y.\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# For any person `p`, if `p` gets `g` and `g` is a `Glu`, then `p` feels tired (as a result of getting `g`).\n# We can try to capture this by saying that 'Glu' is a condition that causes tiredness in people.\n# Let's assume 'Glu' is a type of ailment.\n# \u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 (gets_ailment(p, Glu) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu)))\n# This requires a `gets_ailment` predicate.\n\n# Simplest interpretation that fits the predicates:\n# If `FeelingTired` is a symptom, and `Glu` is something that causes tiredness,\n# then `FeelingTired` is a symptom of `Glu`.\n# `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, x)` means FeelingTired is a symptom of x.\n# If `Glu` is a disease/condition, then `FeelingTired` could be a symptom of `Glu`.\n# So, `SymptomOf(FeelingTired, glu_condition)`.\n# And \"people feel tired when they get a glu\".\n# This is about the *experience* of a person.\n\n# Let's assume the original `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))` was an attempt to say:\n# If `x` is a person AND `x` is afflicted by `Glu` (i.e., `Glu(x)` means `x` has `Glu`),\n# THEN `x` feels tired when they get `Glu`.\n# This still requires `Glu(x)` to mean \"x has Glu\" and `FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x))` to mean \"x feels tired when they get Glu\".\n\n# Let's rephrase the last premise to be clearer, assuming `Glu` represents a condition one can contract.\n# If `x` is a person and `x` contracts `g`, and `g` is a `Glu`, then `x` feels tired.\n# This requires a `contracts` predicate.\n\n# Given the structure, perhaps the intent was that `Glu(x)` means `x` is a glu, and people get \"things\" that are glus.\n# So, for any person `p`, if `p` gets some `g` and `g` is a `Glu`, then `p` feels tired.\n# `\u2200p \u2200g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2227 Gets(p, g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))`\n# We lack `Gets`.\n\n# Let's go back to the original structure and see if a minimal fix can be made.\n# `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x)))`\n# If `Glu(x)` implies `x` is a *glu* (an instance), and `FeelTiredWhen(x, Glu(x))` implies `x` feels tired when they get that `Glu(x)` instance.\n# This is still flawed. The problem is quantifying `Glu(x)` in the consequent as the thing being gotten.\n\n# A simpler approach for the last premise:\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This can be rephrased as: For any person `p`, and for any `g` that is a `Glu`, `p` feels tired when they experience `g`.\n# Let's stick to the original predicate names. If `FeelingTired` is a state, and `Glu` is a condition, this means a person in the state `Glu` feels tired.\n# Let's assume `Glu(x)` represents a person *having* a glu.\n# Then `\u2200x (Person(x) \u2227 Glu(x) \u2192 FeelingTired(x))`\n# This simplifies the original but doesn't use `FeelTiredWhen`.\n\n# If we MUST use `FeelTiredWhen(x, y)`, then `y` must be something that can be \"gotten\".\n# \"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n# This implies that the act of getting a glu causes tiredness.\n# Let's represent 'getting a glu' by an event or a state related to `Glu`.\n# If we consider `Glu` itself as the entity that is \"gotten\".\n# `\u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu))` This states every person feels tired when they get 'Glu' (the concept). Not quite right.\n\n# The best interpretation given the predicates:\n# For any person `p`, if `p` gets something which is a `Glu`, then `p` feels tired.\n# Let `x` be an instance of \"getting a glu\".\n# `\u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 \u2203x (IsGettingAGlu(x, p) \u2227 FeelTiredWhen(p, x)))`\n# We don't have `IsGettingAGlu`.\n\n# Let's assume `Glu` can be used as an event or condition.\n# `\u2200p (Person(p) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, Glu))` - This is still awkward.\n\n# The most direct interpretation of the sentence \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" using the available predicates\n# is to assume that `Glu(x)` represents \"x is a glu\" and `FeelTiredWhen(y, x)` means \"y feels tired when they get x\".\n# So, for any person `p`, and any `g` that is a `Glu`, `p` feels tired when they get `g`.\n# `\u2200p \u2200g (Person(p) \u2227 Glu(g) \u2192 FeelTiredWhen(p, g))` This seems like the most appropriate correction to the problematic last premise.\n\n# Revised premises based on this understanding:\n# Define specific instances for clarity, or keep general. Let's keep general as the original did.\n# `monkeypox` is a specific instance of Monkeypox.\n# `monkeypoxVirus` is a specific instance of MonkeypoxVirus.\n\n# Premises:\nMonkeypox(monkeypox)\nInfectiousDisease(monkeypox)\nCausedBy(monkeypox, monkeypoxVirus)\nMonkeypoxVirus(monkeypoxVirus)\n\n# The original statement \"Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans.\"\n# This implies `MonkeypoxVirus` occurs in `humans` and `animals`.\n# The current predicates are `OccurIn(x, y)` meaning x can occur in y.\n# So `OccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, humans)` and `OccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, animals)` are correct.\n# We also need to establish that humans are a subset of animals.\n# `Human(x) -> Animal(x)` implies this.\n\nOccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, humans)\nOccurIn(monkeypoxVirus, animals)\n\n# \"Humans are mammals.
