Replaced 'Year(y) \u2227 y = 1716' with a dedicated predicate 'MovedYear(yaleUniversity, 1716)' for better readability and to directly associate the year with the move.\n# 2. Changed 'EndowmentValue(yaleUniversity, 42.3billion)' to 'EndowmentValue(yaleUniversity, 42.3_billion_dollars)' to be more specific about the unit and to use a valid identifier for the value.\n# 3. Replaced 'Organized(yaleUniversity, 27)' with 'NumberOfColleges(yaleUniversity, 27)' which is more descriptive of the information conveyed.\n# 4. Renamed 'College(x)' to 'ResidentialCollege(x)' to specifically refer to the list of residential colleges mentioned.\n# 5. Introduced new predicates: 'CollegeOrSchool(cs)', 'ProfessionalSchool(ps)' to categorize the different types of constituent parts of Yale University as described in the text.\n# 6. Added explicit 'Name' assertions for each residential college and the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and a few representative professional schools to ensure all named entities have their names asserted. The original premise '\u2200x (College(x) \u2192 Name(x, x))' was ambiguous and likely incorrect as the predicate 'College(x)' was too broad.\n# 7. Included all listed residential colleges and the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as constituent parts. Added a few representative professional schools to demonstrate how the structure could be extended.\n# 8. The original premise '\u2200x (College(x) \u2192 Name(x, x))' was removed and replaced by explicit Name assertions for each college. This avoids the problematic self-referential naming.\n\n# Conclusion:\nConstituent(piersonCollege, yale) \u2227 PartOf(piersonCollege, residentialColleges)\n",
