Assuming the loan to Braga means he is playing for Braga\n# during the loan period, and possibly still associated with Nautico.\n# However, if loan implies temporary move and he doesn't \"play for\" Nautico\n# during that time, then the original premise \"PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico)\"\n# might be in conflict or needs temporal context.\n# For this revision, we assume the loan implies he is *also* playing for Braga.\n# If he *stops* playing for Nautico while on loan, that would require temporal logic.\n# Given the simplicity of the current predicates, we'll keep both PlaysFor statements.\n# The prompt asks to fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\n# The original `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` is already present.\n# The key nuance is the 'loaned out to Braga'. This suggests he *plays* for Braga.\n# It's common in football that a player on loan plays for the loaned club.\n# The statement `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico)` still holds true if Nautico is his\n# parent club. The problem states \"Ailton Silva is a Brazillian footballer who plays for Nautico.\"\n# and then \"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\"\n# This implies two affiliations.\n\n# Let's consider if \"PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)\" is redundant or should be inferred.\n# If `LoanedTo(x, y)` implies `PlaysFor(x, y)`, then the explicit premise is redundant.\n# However, without a rule, it's safer to keep it if the scenario states it.\n# The scenario states \"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\"\n# and later \"PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico).\" and then in the premises\n# \"PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga).\"\n# It seems the explicit inclusion of `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` is intended.\n\n# Simplifying logic:\n# The predicates are already quite atomic.

The current facts imply he is.\n# What if he wasn't born in 1995?\n# The existing premises seem to cover the stated facts.\n\n# Potential issue: If \"loaned out to Braga\" *implies* he no longer plays for Nautico *during the loan*.\n# The current formulation does not handle this temporal aspect.\n# However, sticking to the provided predicates and avoiding temporal logic,\n# we assume both `PlaysFor` statements are concurrently true in the context of the problem.\n\n# One possible simplification: if the problem implies that `LoanedTo(x, y)` *always* means `PlaysFor(x, y)` for the duration of the loan.\n# We could remove the redundant premise `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` if a rule was added:\n# `LoanedTo(x, y) => PlaysFor(x, y)`.\n# However, the task asks for premises and not rules. And we should not introduce rules.\n# So, keeping the explicit premise `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` is the most direct interpretation.\n\n# Let's refine the phrasing slightly for clarity, but keep the core logic.\n# Using `is_` prefix for predicates can be a convention, let's stick to that.\n\n# The original `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` is already present.\n# The prompt wants to \"fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic\".\n# There's no clear \"bug\" as the premises directly reflect the scenario text.\n# Edge cases are hard to add without more context on what 'missing' implies.\n# Simplification is also difficult without adding inference rules or combining predicates.\n\n# Let's reconsider the `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` statement.\n# \"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\"\n# This strongly implies he plays for Braga *during* the loan.\n# The problem also states \"Ailton Silva is a Brazillian footballer who plays for Nautico.\"\n# So, he has dual affiliations or a primary and a temporary one.\n# The original program has `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico)` and `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)`.\n# This reflects the scenario information accurately.\n\n# A potential simplification could be to remove redundant facts if they can be inferred from others *within the premise set*.\n# E.g., if `LoanedTo(AiltonSilva, Braga)` was meant to imply `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)`.\n# But without rules, this is not a simplification of logic.\n\n# The most reasonable interpretation of the task is to ensure all facts are represented without redundancy or contradiction, and that the syntax is correct.\n# The original program seems correct in terms of representing the facts.\n# Let's assume that \"PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)\" is a *direct* consequence of \"loaned out to Braga\" as per the scenario description.\n# If the problem intends for us to *infer* `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` from `LoanedTo(AiltonSilva, Braga)`, then the explicit premise is redundant.\n\n# However, the task is to write a *new program* that satisfies the problem.\n# This implies we can change the structure slightly.\n# Let's make the names explicit constants to avoid potential ambiguity if they were variables.\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the initial premises:\n# BornIn(AiltonSilva, 1995).\n# KnownAs(AiltonSilva, Ailton).\n# FootballPlayer(AiltonSilva).\n# LoanedTo(AiltonSilva, Braga).\n# Brazilian(AiltonSilva).\n# PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico).\n# FootballClub(Nautico).\n# FootballClub(Braga).\n# FootballClub(Fluminense).\n# PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga).\n\n# The fact \"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga\" *implies* he plays for Braga.\n# The explicit premise `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` is therefore a direct consequence and not an independent fact.\n# The fact \"Ailton Silva is a Brazillian footballer who plays for Nautico.\"\n# This gives `Brazilian(AiltonSilva)`, `FootballPlayer(AiltonSilva)`, and `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Nautico)`.\n\n# Let's consider the possibility that `FootballPlayer(AiltonSilva)` is implied by `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, X)`.\n# If `PlaysFor(x, y)` implies `FootballPlayer(x)`, then `FootballPlayer(AiltonSilva)` is redundant.\n# But the prompt is about premises, not rules.\n\n# What if we use a different naming convention for constants, like lowercase for clarity?\n# AiltonSilva -> ailton_silva\n# Ailton -> ailton\n# Braga -> braga\n# Nautico -> nautico\n# Fluminense -> fluminense\n\n# Let's refine the predicates to be more explicit with `is_`.\n# BornIn(x, y) becomes YearOfBirth(x, y)\n# KnownAs(x, y) becomes Alias(x, y)\n# FootballPlayer(x) becomes IsFootballPlayer(x)\n# LoanedTo(x, y) becomes IsLoanedTo(x, y)\n# Brazilian(x) becomes IsBrazilian(x)\n# PlaysFor(x, y) remains PlaysFor(x, y) or becomes PlaysForClub(x, y) - let's stick to PlaysFor for consistency.\n# FootballClub(x) becomes IsFootballClub(x)\n\n# Let's try to remove redundancy if `LoanedTo` directly implies `PlaysFor`.\n# The scenario states \"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\"\n# This is a very strong indicator that he *plays for* Braga during the loan.\n# If `LoanedTo(x, y)` is a premise, and `PlaysFor(x, y)` is also a premise, it might be redundant.\n# Let's assume `LoanedTo(x, y)` implies `PlaysFor(x, y)`.\n# In that case, the premise `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` is redundant given `LoanedTo(AiltonSilva, Braga)`.\n# The task is to \"fix bugs, add missing edge-cases, or simplify logic.\"\n# Removing a redundant premise is simplification.\n\n# Revised Plan:\n# 1. Rename constants to lowercase_with_underscore.\n# 2. Use `is_` prefix for predicates where appropriate.\n# 3. Remove `PlaysFor(AiltonSilva, Braga)` premise, assuming `IsLoanedTo(AiltonSilva, Braga)` implies it. This is a simplification.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2203x (LoanedTo(AiltonSilva, x) \u2227 FootballClub(x))\n",
