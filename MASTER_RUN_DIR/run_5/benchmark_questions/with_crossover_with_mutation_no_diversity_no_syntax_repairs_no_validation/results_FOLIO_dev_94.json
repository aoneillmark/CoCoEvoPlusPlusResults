The explicit statement \"Fluffy is Tom's cat.\" and \"Cats are pets.\" implies Fluffy is a pet.  The scenario doesn't explicitly state *why* Fluffy is allowed, so we'll assume it's a general rule for managed buildings.\n\n# Corrected Logic for Renting:\n# The original premise `\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))`\n# has an issue with `DepositAmount(b, 1500)`. It should be checking if the actual deposit amount `D` for building `b`\n# is less than 1500, not if there's a deposit of 1500.\n\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))\n# This premise is problematic as written. `DepositAmount(b, 1500)` implies that the deposit *is* 1500.\n# We need to express that Tom rents if Fluffy is allowed AND the *actual* deposit amount for building `b` is less than 1500.\n\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, ?), 1500))))\n# The placeholder `?` needs to be the actual deposit amount for building `b`.\n# We know `DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)`.\n\n# Let's refine the renting condition more accurately:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))\n# This still has the same issue with `DepositAmount(b, 1500)`.\n\n# A more correct way to express the condition:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u2200d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 LessThan(d, 1500)))))\n# This checks if *any* deposit amount `d` associated with building `b` is less than 1500.\n# However, the problem implies a single security deposit amount per building.\n\n# Given: DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n# We know the deposit for Olive Garden is 2000.\n# The condition for Tom renting is `AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500)`.\n# This means `DepositAmount(b, D)` where `D < 1500`.\n\n# Let's use the fact that DepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000) is a fact.\n# The premise `\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))`\n# should be interpreted as:\n# For any managed building `b`, Tom rents an apartment in `b` IFF Fluffy is allowed in `b` AND the security deposit for `b` is less than $1500.\n\n# Corrected Renting Premise:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 \u00acMoreThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))\n# Still incorrect because `DepositAmount(b, 1500)` implies the deposit IS 1500.\n\n# Corrected Renting Premise (using a variable for the deposit amount):\n\u2200b, d (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2227 DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(d, 1500))))\n\n# Let's re-evaluate the original:\n# \u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))\n# This implies `DepositAmount(b, 1500)` means \"the deposit for building b is 1500\". This is likely an error in the original encoding.\n# The intent is likely that `DepositAmount(b, D)` where `D` is the actual deposit amount, and this `D` is compared to 1500.\n\n# Let's define `IsDepositLessThan(b, amount)` for clarity.\nIsDepositLessThan(b, amount) ::: The security deposit for building b is less than `amount`.\n\u2200b, d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 (IsDepositLessThan(b, amount) \u2194 LessThan(d, amount)))\n\n# Now rewrite the renting condition using this predicate:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 IsDepositLessThan(b, 1500))))\n\n# We still need a premise that Fluffy is allowed in managed buildings.\n# The scenario states: \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\"\n# And \"Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy\"\n# This implies that if Tom is considering a managed building, Fluffy *must* be allowed.\n# The original `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, x))` was too broad.\n# Let's stick to what's implied by Tom's condition.\n\n# Based on the scenario, if Tom is considering renting, Fluffy must be allowed in *that specific managed building*.\n# So, if `Rent(tom, b)` is true, then `ManagedBuilding(b)` and `AllowedPet(fluffy, b)` must be true.\n# And the rent condition `\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500))))` is the core.\n\n# Revisiting the problematic predicate `LessThan(DepositAmount(b, 1500), 1500)`:\n# This is stating \"The deposit amount for building b, which is 1500, is less than 1500\". This is a contradiction if the deposit is indeed 1500.\n# The intended meaning is that the *actual* deposit amount for building `b` is less than 1500.\n\n# Let's make a clearer predicate for deposit amount comparison.\nSecurityDepositLessThan(b, amount) ::: The security deposit for building b is less than `amount`.\n\u2200b, d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 (SecurityDepositLessThan(b, amount) \u2194 LessThan(d, amount)))\n\n# Now the premise for renting becomes:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 SecurityDepositLessThan(b, 1500))))\n\n# We also need to establish `AllowedPet(fluffy, b)` for managed buildings.\n# The scenario says \"Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\"\n# And Tom will rent if Fluffy is allowed.\n# Let's assume for the purpose of Tom's decision, Fluffy is generally allowed in managed buildings.\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, b))\n\n# Final Proposed Premises:\nManagedBuilding(oliveGarden)\nRentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\nTom(tom)\nFluffy(fluffy)\nCat(fluffy)\n\u2200x (Cat(x) \u2192 Pet(x))\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 AllowedPet(fluffy, b)) # Fluffy is allowed in any managed building.\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 DepositRequired(b))\n\u2200b (DepositRequired(b) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(b) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(b)))\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)\n\u2200x, y (RentAmount(x, y) \u2192 (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2228 \u2203z (MoreThan(z, y) \u2227 DepositAmount(x, z)))) # Deposit is either one month's rent or more.\n\u2200x, y, z (DepositAmount(x, y) \u2227 RentAmount(x, z) \u2192 (y = z \u2228 MoreThan(y, z))) # Explicit relationship of deposit amount to rent.\n\n# Predicate for deposit amount comparison:\nSecurityDepositLessThan(b, amount) ::: The security deposit for building b is less than `amount`.\n\u2200b, d (DepositAmount(b, d) \u2192 (SecurityDepositLessThan(b, amount) \u2194 LessThan(d, amount)))\n\n# Tom's renting condition:\n\u2200b (ManagedBuilding(b) \u2192 (Rent(tom, b) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, b) \u2227 SecurityDepositLessThan(b, 1500))))\n\n# Explicitly state the known comparison\nMoreThan(2000, 1500)\n\n# Conclusion:\n(DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(oliveGarden) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(oliveGarden))\n",
