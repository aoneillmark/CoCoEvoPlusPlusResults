Changed the second rule: Instead of explicitly saying \"Gains knowledge (k)\", this version simplifies the inference by stating that reading a book means gaining *the book* as something that contributes to knowledge. This avoids needing a separate, potentially unspecified, knowledge entity 'k' directly linked to the book's content. The implication is that the *act* of reading and engaging with the book is the source of the 'knowledge gain'.\n#    - Original concept: Person reads Book -> gains Knowledge contained in Book.\n#    - Simplified concept: Person reads Book -> gains the Book (or its essence) as knowledge.\n# 2. Changed the third rule: Directly links the act of 'Gains(p, b)' (where 'b' is a book) to Smarter(p).
