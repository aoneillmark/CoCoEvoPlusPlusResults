The previous interpretation was 'p gains knowledge from b'.\n# Let's stick to the original intent of gaining \"knowledge\".\n# If we use a specific knowledge instance per book, it's complex.\n# A better approach is to generalize: If a book has content, and someone reads it, they gain *some* knowledge.\n# Let's try to express that reading a book leads to gaining *some* knowledge.\n# The previous rule: \u2200p \u2200b (Person(p) \u2227 Reads(p, b) \u2192 Gains(p, Knowledge_from(b)))\n# This suggests a function Knowledge_from(b). Let's make it explicit that this is knowledge.\n# Let's define a new constant or a way to represent generic \"knowledge from a book\".\n# Option 1: Introduce a specific knowledge instance for each book. This is likely too complex.\n# Option 2: Use the concept of \"gaining knowledge\" without specifying *what* knowledge.\n# The original program seems to implicitly assume there is a connection between books and knowledge.\n# Let's refine the \"Gains\" predicate. If reading implies gaining knowledge, and books *contain* knowledge,\n# then we should link these.\n\n# Let's assume each book is a source of knowledge. When someone reads it, they gain that knowledge.\n# Predicate: KnowledgeFrom(b, k) ::: k is the knowledge from book b.\n# This requires adding KnowledgeFrom to the vocabulary. The prompt says \"Generally keep the same vocabulary\".\n# The original program uses Knowledge_from(b). This looks like a function.\n# Let's stick to the interpretation of the original program using a function if possible.\n# If Knowledge_from(b) is a function that returns knowledge, then the statement is:\n# \u2200p \u2200b (Person(p) \u2227 Reads(p, b) \u2192 Gains(p, Knowledge_from(b)))\n# This implies that Knowledge_from(b) *is* knowledge.\n# We need to ensure that Knowledge_from(b) represents knowledge.\n# So, if a person reads a book, they gain the knowledge *that is from* that book.\n# And this \"knowledge from book\" must be of type Knowledge.\n\n# Refined Axiom 1: Books contain knowledge.\n# \u2200b (Book(b) \u2192 \u2203k (Knowledge(k) \u2227 Contains(b, k)))\n# This implies there's an existential knowledge k contained in book b.\n# This is good.\n\n# Refined Axiom 2: When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.\n# The original `\u2200p \u2200b (Person(p) \u2227 Reads(p, b) \u2192 Gains(p, Knowledge_from(b)))`\n# implies `Knowledge_from(b)` is what is gained.\n# We need to ensure that what is gained is indeed knowledge.\n# If `Knowledge_from(b)` is a function that *returns* knowledge, then this is implicitly handled.\n# However, if `Knowledge_from` is not defined as returning knowledge, we need to state it.\n# Let's assume the intent is that `Knowledge_from(b)` represents a specific instance of knowledge derived from book `b`.\n# And that this instance of knowledge is what is gained.\n# The previous formulation implies `Gains(p, k)` where `k` is `Knowledge_from(b)`.\n# If `Knowledge_from(b)` is just a term, we need to ensure it's a `Knowledge`.\n# We can define `IsKnowledgeFrom(term, book)`\n# Or, we can assert that `Knowledge_from(b)` is of type `Knowledge`.\n# This requires `IsKnowledge(term)`. Let's assume `Knowledge(x)` means `x` is knowledge.\n# So, we need: \u2200b (\u2200p (Person(p) \u2227 Reads(p, b) \u2192 Gains(p, Knowledge_from(b)))) implies that `Knowledge_from(b)` is knowledge.\n# Let's assert that for any book `b`, `Knowledge_from(b)` is a type of Knowledge.\n\u2200b (Book(b) \u2192 Knowledge(Knowledge_from(b)))\n# Now, if someone reads book `b`, they gain `Knowledge_from(b)`.\n\u2200p \u2200b (Person(p) \u2227 Reads(p, b) \u2192 Gains(p, Knowledge_from(b)))\n# This seems to correctly capture \"When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.\"\n# It implicitly connects reading to the specific knowledge derived from that book.\n\n# Refined Axiom 3: If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\n# This axiom is already quite clear and correct.\n\u2200p \u2200k (Gains(p, k) \u2192 Smarter(p))\n# The existential quantifier for knowledge in the first axiom implies that if a book exists, there is knowledge.\n# And the second axiom connects reading to gaining knowledge.\n# The problem doesn't explicitly state that a person *must* read a book to gain knowledge.\n# However, the context \"Harry read the book 'Walden'\" focuses on this specific path.\n\n# The original program also had:\n# \u2200b (Book(b) \u2192 \u2203t (Title(b, t)))\n# \u2200b (Book(b) \u2192 \u2203a (Author(a, b)))\n# These are implicit in the premises by providing titles and authors.\n# However, if we were to infer *all* books, these would be useful.\n# Given the context focuses on Harry reading Walden, these are not strictly necessary for the inference about Harry.\n# But they are good general rules about books. Let's keep them.\n# The structure `Title(x, y)` and `Author(x, y)` means `x` has title `y` and `x` is author of `y`.\n# The premise `Author(henrythoreau, walden)` correctly uses this.\n\n# Let's consolidate the revised premises and axioms.\n# We are using `Knowledge_from(b)` as a function term representing knowledge derived from book `b`.\n# We are asserting that this term represents knowledge.\n\n# Revised Program:\n\n# Conclusion:\n\u2200x (Smarter(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Gains(x, y)))\n",
