It likely means \"the deposit amount associated with building x is 1500\".\n# So, the premise means: `Tom rents building x <=> Fluffy is allowed in x AND the security deposit for x is LESS THAN 1500`.\n\n# Let's introduce a new predicate to explicitly state the deposit amount for Olive Garden.\nDepositAmount(oliveGarden, Y) :- RentAmount(oliveGarden, R), MoreThan(R, 1500).\n# This is an assumption. The problem doesn't explicitly state the deposit amount for Olive Garden.\n# However, the premise `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)))`\n# and `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and `MoreThan(2000, 1500)` implies that the deposit amount for Olive Garden is *at least* 2000 if it's equal to one month's rent.\n# If the deposit is *more* than one month's rent, it could be anything above 2000.\n\n# Let's try a more direct representation of the conditions on the deposit.\n# We need to know if the deposit for Olive Garden is <= 1500.\n\n# New approach:\n# Add a premise that explicitly states the deposit for Olive Garden.\n# Since the problem provides `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and `MoreThan(2000, 1500)`, and the rule for deposits in managed buildings,\n# we can't *know* the exact deposit for Olive Garden without more information.\n# However, the premise about Tom renting states `LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500)`.\n# This implies that if the deposit amount *is* 1500, it's not less than 1500.\n# If the deposit amount is actually *less than* 1500, then this condition is met.\n\n# Let's explicitly state the deposit amount for Olive Garden, and then check the condition.\n# The prompt is trying to test reasoning about numerical comparisons and conditions.\n\n# Revised Premise 4: Fluffy is Tom's cat.\nFluffy(fluffy)\nTom(tom)\nOwns(tom, fluffy)\nCat(fluffy)\n\n# Revised Premise 7: Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n# We need to explicitly state what the deposit amount for Olive Garden is, or make it derivable.\n# The problem gives `RentAmount(oliveGarden, 2000)` and `MoreThan(2000, 1500)`.\n# And the rule `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (DepositEqualToOneMonthRent(x) \u2228 DepositGreaterThanOneMonthRent(x)))`.\n# This means the deposit for Olive Garden is either 2000 or > 2000. In either case, the deposit is > 1500.\n# So, the condition \"security deposit is no more than $1500\" is NOT met for Olive Garden.\n\n# Let's simplify the last premise and add a fact about Olive Garden's deposit.\n# We can deduce that the deposit for Olive Garden is NOT <= 1500.\n# The premise `\u2200x (ManagedBuilding(x) \u2192 (Rent(tom, x) \u2194 (AllowedPet(fluffy, x) \u2227 LessThan(DepositAmount(x, 1500), 1500))))`\n# is still problematic as `DepositAmount(x, 1500)` implies the deposit IS 1500.\n# It should be `DepositAmount(x, D)` and then `LessThan(D, 1500)`.\n\n# Let's rewrite the key premise with a more clear predicate for deposit comparison.\n# We need a predicate `DepositIsNoMoreThan(building, amount)` which means the deposit amount for `building` is <= `amount`.\n\n# Let's define `DepositAmountFor(building, amount)` and `DepositIsNoMoreThan(building, amount)`.\n\n# Redefining some predicates for clarity, or using existing ones more precisely.\n# `DepositAmount(x, y)`: The security deposit for building `x` is `y`.\n\n# Let's add the actual deposit for Olive Garden.
